Everybody saying everything 's alright
Still I can't close my eyes
I 'm seeing a tunnel at the end of all these lights
Sunny days
Where have you gone ?
I get the strangest feeling you belong
Why does it always rain on me ?
Is it because I lied when I was seventeen ?
Why does it always rain on me ?
Even when the sun is shining
I can't avoid the lightning
I can't stand myself
I 'm being held up by an invisible man
Still life on a shelf when
I got my mind on something else
Sunny days
Where have you gone ?
I get the strangest feeling you belong
Why does it always rain on me ?
Is it because I lied when I was seventeen ?
Why does it always rain on me ?
Even when the sun is shining
I can't avoid the lightning
Oh , where did the blue skies go ?
And why is it raining so ?
It 's so cold
I can't sleep tonight
Everybody 's saying everything 's all right
Still I can't close my eyes
I 'm seeing a tunnel at the end of the lights
Sunny days
Where have you gone ?
I get the strangest feeling you belong
Why does it always rain on me ?
Is it because I lied when I was seventeen ?
Even when the sun is shining
I can't avoid the lightning
Oh , where did the blue skies go ?
And why is it raining so ?
It 's so cold
Why does it always rain on me ?
Why does it always rain on .
Before my head explodes ,
Or my head starts to ring .
We 've been living life inside a bubble ,
We 've been living life inside a bubble .
Confidence in you ,
Is confidence in me ,
Is confidence in high speed .
Can anybody stop this thing
Before my head explodes ,
Or my head starts to ring .
We 've been living life inside a bubble ,
We 've been living life inside a bubble .
Confidence in you ,
Is confidence in me ,
Is confidence in high speed .
In high speed ,
High speed .
High speed you on ,
High speed you on ,
High speed you on .
Don't want a nation under the new mania .
And can you hear the sound of hysteria ?
The subliminal mind fuck America .
Welcome to a new kind of tension .
All across the alienation .
Everything isn't meant to be okay .
Television dreams of tomorrow .
We 're not the ones who 're meant to follow .
For that 's enough to argue .
Well maybe I 'm the faggot America .
I 'm not a part of a redneck agenda .
Now everybody do the propaganda .
And sing along in the age of paranoia .
Welcome to a new kind of tension .
All across the alienation .
Everything isn't meant to be okay .
Television dreams of tomorrow .
We 're not the ones who 're meant to follow .
For that 's enough to argue .
Don't wanna be an American idiot .
One nation controlled by the media .
Information age of hysteria .
It 's calling out to idiot America .
Welcome to a new kind of tension .
All across the alienation .
Everything isn't meant to be okay .
Television dreams of tomorrow .
We 're not the ones who 're meant to follow .
For that 's enough to argue .
Seas would rise when I gave the word .
Now in the morning I sleep alone ,
Sweep the streets , I used to own .
I used to roll the dice ,
Feel the fear in my enemies ' eyes ,
Listen as the crowd would sing ,
" Now the old is King dead , long live the King . "
One minute I held the key ,
Next , the walls were closed on me .
And I discovered that my castles ' stand ,
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand .
I here Jerusalem bells a ringing ,
Roman Calvary choirs are singing .
Be my mirror , my sword and shield ,
My missionaries in a foreign field .
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go , it was never ,
Never an honest word .
And that was when I ruled the world .
It was the wicked and wild wind ,
Blew down the doors to let me in .
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I 'd become .
Revolutionaries wait ,
For my head on a silver plate .
Just a puppet on a lonely string ,
Oh , who would ever want to be king ?
I here Jerusalem bells a ringing ,
Roman Calvary choirs are singing .
Be my mirror , my sword and shield ,
My missionaries in a foreign field .
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name .
Never an honest word ,
But that was when I ruled the world .
I here Jerusalem bells a ringing ,
Roman Calvary choirs are singing .
Be my mirror , my sword and shield ,
My missionaries in a foreign field .
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name .
Never an honest word .
But that was when I ruled the world .
floating image in my mind
Now I wonder where this place is from
Evidence is everywhere
I start to run , now I 'm scared
Strange beings all around .
Everyone come to this place I 've found
I 'm feeling phyced
walking wonder why
All my joys are open
No more crimes
My eyes are clear and now I 'm cured
I only wanna be for sure
Get in my mind and you will find
Mother love from all mankind
And all those nice things
You FINALLY got what you want
Someone to look good with
AND light your cigarette
Is this what you really want
I figured out what you 're all about
And I don't think I like what I see
SOOOOO .
I HOPE I won't be there in the end
if you come around .
How long will he last
Before he 's a CREEP in the past
And you 're alone once again
Will you pop up AGAIN and be my
" SPECIAL FRIEND " ' till the end
And when will that be
I figured out what you 're all about
And I don't think I like what I see
SOOOOO .
I HOPE I won't be there in the end
if you come around .
I figured out what you 're all about
And I don't think I like what I see
SOOOOO .
I HOPE I won't be there in the end
if you come around .
to listen to me whine
About NOTHING and EVERYTHING
all at once
I am one of those
Melodramatic fools
Neurotic to the bone
No doubt about it
Sometimes I give myself the CREEPS
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I 'm CRACKING UP
Am I just PARANOID
Or am I just STONED
I went to a shrink
To analyze my dreams
SHE says it 's lack of sex
that 's bringing me down
I went to a whore
HE said my life 's a bore
So quit my whining cause
it 's bringing HER down
Sometimes I give myself the CREEPS
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I 'm CRACKING UP
Am I just PARANOID
Uh , yuh , yuh , ya
Grasping to CONTROL
So I BETTER hold on
Sometimes I give myself the CREEPS
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I 'm CRACKING UP
Am I just PARANOID
Or am I just STONED

I knew I was being threatened
Do you think it was worth holding out

Ugly stories

Watch them flee . watch them flee
Rap rap rap up
Watch them flee
Hip-Hop hits
And you do it like this
[ Mike Shinoba ]
[ Verse 1 ]
It 's going down
The rhythm projects ' round the next sound
Reflects the complex hybrid dialect now
Detects the mesh of many elements compressed down
The melting pot of a super-futureesque style
The combination of vocal caress
With lungs the gasp for breath
From emotional stress
With special effects
And a distorted collage
Carefully lodged between beats of rhythmic barrage
It 's going down
The logical progression on the timeline
The seperation narrowed down to a fine line
To blur the edges so they blend together properly
Take you on an audible odyssey
Now it 's going down
A logical progression on the timeline
The seperation narrowed down to a fine line
To blur the edges so they blend together properly
Take you on an audible odyssey
Now it 's going down
[ X-ecutioners with Mike Shinoba ]
[ Chorus ]
Put put . put it up
I said it goes like this
And you do it like this
It 's going down
Put put . put it up
I said it goes goes like this
And you do it like this
It 's going down
[ Mike Shinoba ]
[ Verse 3 ]
Once again it is
Composed sentences
All together venomous
The four elements of natural force
Projected daily through the sound of the source
Everybody on board as we blend
The sword with the pen
The mightiest the weapons
Swinging right from the chin
To elevate of mental states
Long gone with the wind
To defend men from shoddy imitation pretends
It 's going down
Stalence emulation readily
Trekking through the weaponry
Of the pure pedigree
Cleverly seeing through whatever is ahead of me
Whatever the weather be
We invent the steadily
It 's going down sub-terrestrial high
I rhyme regiment that 's calling the shots
Exectution of colloborative plots
Ready to bring the seperation of style to a stop
A logical progression on the timeline
The seperation narrowed down to a fine line
To blur the edges so they blend together properly
Take you on an audible odyssey
Now it 's going down
[ X-ecutioners with Mike Shinoba ]
[ Chorus ]

For this moment to come
I 'm destined
For anything.at all
Downtown lights will be shining
On me like a diamond
Ring out under the midnight hour
No one can touch me now
And I can't turn my back
It 's too late ready or not at all
I 'm so much closer than
I have ever known .
Wake up
Dawning of a new era
Calling . don't let it catch you falling
Ready or not at all
So close enough to taste it
Alomost . I can embrace this
Feeling . on the tip of my tongue
I 'm so much closer than
I have ever known .
Wake up
Better thank your lucks stars .
I 've been waiting for a long time
For this moment to come
I 'm destined for anything at all
Dumbstruck
Colour me stupid
Good luck
You 're gonna need it
Where I 'm going if I get there .
At all .
Wake up
Better thank your lucky stars .
I 'm the son of rage and love
The Jesus of suburbia
From the bible of none of the above
On a steady diet of soda pop and Ritalin
No one ever died for my sins in hell
As far as I can tell
At least the ones I got away with
And there 's nothing wrong with me
This is how I 'm supposed to be
In a land of make believe
That don't believe in me
Get my television fix sitting on my crucifix
The living room or my private womb
While the moms and brads are away
To fall in love and fall in debt
To alcohol and cigarettes and Mary Jane
To keep me insane and doing someone else 's cocaine
And there 's nothing wrong with me
This is how I 'm supposed to be
In a land of make believe
That don't believe in me
[ Part 2 : City Of The Damned ]
At the center of the Earth
In the parking lot
Of the 7-11 were I was taught
The motto was just a lie
It says home is where your heart is
But what a shame
Cause everyone 's heart
Doesn't beat the same
It 's beating out of time
City of the dead
At the end of another lost highway
Signs misleading to nowhere
City of the damned
Lost children with dirty faces today
No one really seems to care
I read the graffiti
In the bathroom stall
Like the holy scriptures of a shopping mall
And so it seemed to confess
It didn't say much
But it only confirmed that
The center of the earth
Is the end of the world
And I could really care less
City of the dead
At the end of another lost highway
Signs misleading to nowhere
City of the damned
Lost children with dirty faces today
No one really seems to careeeeee
[ Part 3 : I don't care ]
I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't care
[ x4 ]
I don't careeeeeeeeee
Everyone is so full of shit
Born and raised by hypocrites
Hearts recycled but never saved
From the cradle to the grave
We are the kids of war and peace
From Anaheim to the middle east
We are the stories and disciples
Of the Jesus of suburbia
Land of make believe
And it don't believe in me
Land of make believe
And I don't believe
And I don't care !
I don't care ! [ x4 ]
[ Part 4 : Dearly beloved ]
Dearly beloved are you listening ?
I can't remember a word that you were saying
Are we demented or am I disturbed ?
The space that 's in between insane and insecure
Oh therapy , can you please fill the void ?
Am I retarded or am I just overjoyed
Nobody 's perfect and I stand accused
For lack of a better word , and that 's my best excuse
[ Part 5 : Tales of another broken home ]
To live and not to breathe
Is to die In tragedy
To run , to run away
To find what you believe
And I leave behind
This hurricane of fucking lies
I lost my faith to this
This town that don't exist
So I run
I run away
To the light of masochist
And I leave behind
This hurricane of fucking lies
And I walked this line
A million and one fucking times
But not this time
I don't feel any shame
I won't apologize
When there ain't nowhere you can go
Running away from pain
When you 've been victimized
Tales from another broken home
You 're leaving .
Ah you 're leaving home .
Do I follow my instincts blindly
Do I hide my pride / from these bad dreams
And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening
Do I / sit here and try to stand it
Or do I / try to catch them red handed
Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness ,
Or do I trust nobody and live in loneliness
Because I can't hold on / when I 'm stretched so thin
I make the right moves but I 'm lost within
I put on my daily façade but then
I just end up getting hurt again
By myself [ myself ]
I ask why , but in my mind
I find I can't rely on myself
chorus :
I can't hold on
To what I want when I 'm stretched so thin
It 's all too much to take in
I can't hold on
To anything watching everything spin
With thoughts of failure sinking in
If I
Turn my back I 'm defenseless
And to go blindly seems senseless
If I hide my pride and let it all go on / then they 'll
Take from me ' till everything is gone
If I let them go I 'll be outdone
But if I try to catch them I 'll be outrun
If I 'm killed by the questions like a cancer
Then I 'll be buried in the silence of the answer
[ by myself ]
How do you think / I 've lost so much
I 'm so afraid / I 'm out of touch
How do you expect / I will know what to do
When all I know / Is what you tell me to
Don't you know
I can't tell you how to make it go
No matter what I do , how hard I try
I can't seem to convince myself why
I 'm stuck on the outside
So loving you must be like suicide
I don't mind if you don't mind
I 'm not the one that 's going to die
I guess i just can't listen
To this one sided conversation again
`cause I don't care if I don't care
No one ever said that life is fair
Everybody loves a joke
But no one likes a fool
And you 're always cracking the same old lines again
You 're well rehearsed on every verse
And that was stated clear
But no one understands your verity
The center of attention
Got an honerable mention once again
Congratulations and salutations
You 're a figment of your own imagination
Everybody loves a joke
But no one likes a fool
And you 're always cracking the same old lines again
You 're well rehearsed on every verse
And that was stated clear
But no one understands your verity
To know you is to bait you
And you fell victim to your own denial
I don't mind if you don't mind
If you 're wasting all your time
Now my back 's on the line
My back 's on the ropes
When it started we were alright
But night makes a fool
of us in the daylight
Then we were dying of frustration
Saying Lord lead me not into temptation
But it 's not easy when she turns you on
Sin , stay gone
If you 'd only , if you 'd only say yes
Whether you will 's anybody 's guess
God only God knows I 'm trying my best
But I 'm just so tired of this loneliness
Hey
So up they picked me by the big toe
I was held from the rooftop then they let go
Dizzily screaming ' Let the windows down '
As I crawl to the ground
If you 'd only if you 'd only say yes
Whether you will 's anybody 's guess
God only God knows she won't let me rest
But I 'm just so tired of this loneliness
I 've become so tired of this loneliness
Let your heart be light
From now on , our troubles will be out of sight
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
From now on , our troubles will be far away
Here we are , as in olden days
Happy golden days gone by
Oldest friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us
Once more
Through the years , we all have been together
If the saints allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now
The innocent can never last
Wake me up when september ends
Like my fathers come to pass
Seven years has gone so fast
Wake me up when september ends
Here comes the rain again
Falling from the stars
Drenched in my pain again
Becoming who we are
As my memory rests
But never forgets what I lost
Wake me up when september ends
Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
Wake me up when september ends
Ring out the bells again
Like we did when spring began
Wake me up when september ends
Here comes the rain again
Falling from the stars
Drenched in my pain again
Becoming who we are
As my memory rests
But never forgets what I lost
Wake me up when september ends
Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
Wake me up when september ends
Like my father 's come to pass
Twenty years has gone so fast
Wake me up when september ends
Change the channels for an hour or two
Twiddle my thumbs just for a bit
I 'm sick of all the same old shoot
In a house with unlocked doors
And I 'm freaking lazy
Bite my lip and close my eyes
Take me away to paradise
I 'm so darn bored I 'm going BLIND !
And I smell like shoot
Peel me off this velcro seat and get me moving
I sure as heck can't do it by myself
I 'm feeling like a DOG IN HEAT
Barred indoors from the summer street
I locked the door to MY OWN CELL
And I lost the key
Bite my lip and close my eyes
Take me away to paradise
I 'm so darn bored I 'm going BLIND !
And I smell like shoot
I GOT NO MOTIVATION
WHERE IS MY MOTIVATION
NO TIME FOR THE MOTIVATION
SMOKING MY INSPIRATION
Sit around and watch the phone , but no one 's calling
Call me pathetic , call me WHAT YOU WILL
My mother says to get a job
But she don't like the one SHE 'S got
When masturbation 's lost its fun
You 're freaking lazy
Bite my lip and close my eyes
Take me away to paradise
I 'm so darn BORED
I 'm going blind
And loneliness has to suffice
Bite my lip and close my eyes
I was slipping away to paradise
Some say , " Quit or I 'll go BLIND . "
But it 's just a myth
When you can't get the top off from
the bottom of the barrel ,
Wide open road of my future now .
It 's looking freaking narrow .
All I know is that I don't know nothing .
We get told to decide .
Just like as if I 'm not going to change my mind .
All I know is that I don't know nothing .
Whatcha gonna do with yourself ,
Boy better make up your mind .
Whatcha gonna do with yourself boy ,
You 're running out of time .
This time I got it all figured out :
All I know is that I don't know nothing .
And that 's fine .
A whisper , a whisper , a whisper , a whisper
I hear a sound
The ticking of clocks
I remember your face
Remember to see where you are not
I hear the sound
The ticking of clocks
Come back and look for me , look for me
When I am lost
Just a whisper , a whisper , a whisper , a whisper
Night turns to day
And I still ? close to you .
Please just look back
Should I go forward to come back to you .
Night turns to day ,
And I still get no answers
Just a whisper , a whisper , a whisper , a whisper
I hear the sound
The ticking of clocks
I remember your face
Remember to see when you are lost
I hear the sound
The ticking of clocks
Come back and look for me , look for me
When I am lost
Just a whisper , a whisper , a whisper , a whisper
Just a whisper , a whisper , a whisper , a whisper
In his " vintage suit " and tie
He 's casualty dressed to the teeth
In the latest genocide
The new seasons come and go
At the dog and pony show
Gonna sit and beg and fetch the names
And fallow the dress codes
WHAT 'S IN A NAME . HEY !
She 's a scented magazine
Looking sharp and living clean
Living well and dressed to kill
But she looks like hell to me
So when you 're dancing throgh your wardrope
Do the anorex - a go-go
Cloaked with style
For pedophiles as the credit card explodes

Going twice .
Now it 's gone

You auctioned off your life
For the " most " expensive price
Going once .
Going twice .
Now it 's gone
What 's in a name , hey
What 's in a name
I feel my time , my time has come .
Let me in , unlock the door .
I 've never felt this way before .
The wheels just keep on turning ,
The drummer begins to drum ,
I don't know which way I 'm going ,
I don't know which way I 've come .
Hold my hand inside your hands ,
I need someone who understands .
I need someone , someone who hears ,
For you , I 've waited all these years .
For you , I 'd wait ' til kingdom come .
Until my day , my day is done .
And say you 'll come , and set me free ,
Just say you 'll wait , you 'll wait for me .
In your tears and in your blood ,
In your fire and in your flood ,
I hear you laugh , I heard you say ,
" I wouldn't change a single thing . "
The wheels just keep on turning ,
The drummers begin to drum ,
I don't know which way I 'm going ,
I don't know what I 've become .
For you , I 'd wait ' til kingdom come ,
Until my days , my days are done .
Say you 'll come and set me free ,
Just say you 'll wait , you 'll wait for me .
She had a compound fracture in the " trunk "
It started when she run away
Thumbs out out on the interstate
She hitched a ride to misery
" Mr. Whirly " had a catastrophic incident
He fell into the city by the bay
He liquidated his estate
Now he sleeps upon the Haight
Panhanding misery
He 's gonna get high
When he 's low
The fire burns from better days
And she screems why
I said I don't know
The catastrophic hymnes from yesterday
Of misery
Vinnie was a hustler out of Amsterdam
He ran the drug cartel in " tinseltown "
They found him in a cadillac
Bludgeoned with a baseball bat in the name
Of misery
Gina hit the road to New York City
Mysteriously the night Vinnie croaked
She stopped in Vegas to elope
With Virgina and the dope
And kissed the bride eternally
And they 're gonna get high
When they 're low
The fire burns from better days
And he screems why
I said I don't know
The catastrophic hymnes from yesterday
Of misery
Hell hounds on your trail now once again . boy
It 's groping on your leg until it sleeps
The emptiness will fill your soul with sorrow
Because it 's not what ypu make , it 's what you leave
And we 're gonna get high
When I 'm low
The fire burns from better days
And she screems why
I said I don't know
The catastrophic hymnes from yesterday
Of misery
I 'd like to break you fucking teeth .
Stick a knife in the center of your back .
You better grow some eyes in the back of your head .
I fight dirty , just like your looks .
Can't take , can't take , can't take anymore .
Take back , Take back , Take .
The taste of bad blood on the tip of my tongue .
An eye for an eye .
Gun for a gun .
Cold-cocked and I 'm taking back what 's mine .
Expect it when you 're least expecting it .
No loss of love , the smell of regret .
Lights out
Can't take anymore
Shit
I 'll be round , I 'll be loving you always , always ,
Here I am and I 'll take my time ,
Here I am and I 'll wait in line always , always .
To take me anywhere in seconds ,
To take me anywhere I wanna go ,
And drive around a faster car ,
I will settle for nothing less ,
I wanna be bigger , stronger , drive a faster car ,
At the touch of a button ,
I can go anywhere I wanna go ,
And drive around my faster car ,
I will settle for nothing less ,
I think I want to change my attitude .
I think I want to change my oxygen .
I think I want to change my air ,
My amorous fear , I wanna choke ,
I wanna be bigger , stronger , drive a faster car ,
To take me anywhere in seconds ,
To take me anywhere I wanna go ,
And drive around my faster car ,
I will settle for nothing less ,
I think I need to change my attitude ,
I think I want to change my oxygen .
I think I want to change my air ,
My amorous fear , I wanna choke ,
Bigger , better ,
Bigger and better ,
Bigger , stronger , drive a faster car ,
At the touch of a button ,
I can go anywhere I wanna go
And the cat 's caught in the dryer
Philiosophy 's a liar when
Your home is your headstone
" Icon " is the last chance for hope
When there 's no such thing as heroes
Your faith lies in the ditch that
You dug yourself in
Last chance to piss it all away
Nothing but hell to pay
When the lights are going down
Deadbeat Holiday - celebrate your own decay
There 's a vacant sign that 's hanging high
On a noose over your home
Deadbeat Holiday - get on your knees and pray
There 's a vacant sign that 's hanging high
But at least you 're not alone
Christmas lights in the middle of August
Grudges come back to haunt us
Your oldest allies are your long lost enemies
Grounded in a duplex to find that
You 're living on a landmine
Vacation hotspots is a cemetery drive
Last chance to piss it all away
Nothing but hell to pay
When the lights are going down
Deadbeat Holiday - celebrate your own decay
There 's a vacant sign that 's hanging high
On a noose over your home
Deadbeat Holiday - get on your knees and pray
There 's a vacant sign that 's hanging high
But at least you 're not alone
Last chance to piss it all away
Nothing but hell to pay whan all you
Want to do is . not to . give up .
Before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame
Puts your name to shame
Cover up your face
You can't run the race
The pace is too fast
You just won't last
You love the way i look at you
While taking pleasure in the awful things you put me through
You take away if i give in
My life
My pride is broken
[ Chorus :]
You like to think you 're never wrong
( You live what you learn )
You have to act like you 're someone
( You live what you learn )
You want someone to hurt like you
( You live what you learn )
You want to share what you have been through
( You live what you learn )
You love the things i say i 'll do
The way i 'll hurt myself again just get back at you
You take away when I give in
My life
My pride is broken
[ Chorus ]
[ repeat again the song ]
Crawling in my skin
Without a sence of confidence
Consuming , confusing
Crawling in my skin
Without a sence of confidence
I 'm convinced that there 's just too much pressure to take
There 's something inside me
That pulls beneath the surface
Crawling in my skin
These wounds , they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing , confusing what is real
Confusing what is real
There 's something inside me
That pulls beneath the surface
Consuming , confusing
This lack of self-control
I fear is never ending
Controlling , I can't seem
To find myself again
My walls are closing in
Without a sence of confidence
I 'm convinced that there 's just too much pressure to take
I 've felt this way before
So insecure
Crawling in my skin
These wounds , they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real
Discomfort endlessly has pulled itself upon me
Distracting , reacting
Against my will , I stand beside my own reflection
It 's haunting
How I can't seem
To find myself again
