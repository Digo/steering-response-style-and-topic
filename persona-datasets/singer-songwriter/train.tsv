My walls are closing in
Without a sence of confidence
I 'm convinced that there 's just too much pressure to take
I 've felt this way before
So insecure
Without a sence of confidence
I 'm convinced that there 's just too much pressure to take
Without a sence of confidence
I 'm convinced that there 's just too much pressure to take
To find myself again
My walls are closing in
Without a sence of confidence
I 'm convinced that there 's just too much pressure to take
I 've felt this way before
So insecure
Crawling in my skin
These wounds , they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real
Crawling in my skin
These wounds , they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real
Upon which I stand
And I came here to talk
I hope you understand
The green eyes , yeah the spotlight , shines upon you
And how could , anybody , deny you
I came here with a load
And it feels so much lighter now I met you
And honey you should know
That I could never go on without you
Green eyes
Honey you are the sea
Upon which I float
And I came here to talk
I think you should know
The green eyes , you 're the one that I wanted to find
And anyone who tried to deny you , must be out of their mind
Because I came here with a load
And it feels so much lighter since I met you
Honey you should know
That I could never go on without you
Green eyes , green eyes
Oh oh oh oh [ x4 ]
Honey you are a rock
Upon which I stand
Now I 'm just another shootty old man .
I don't have fun and I hate everything .
The world owes me , so freak you .
Glory days don't mean shoot to me .
I drank a six pack of apathy .
Life 's a bitch and so am I .
The world owes me , so freak you .
Wasted youth and a fustful of ideals .
I had a young and optimisitic point of view .
Wasted youth and a fustful of ideals .
I had a young and optimisitic point of view .
I 've decomposed , yet my gut 's getting fat .
Oh my god I 'm turning out like my dad .
I 'm just a grouch sitting on the couch .
The world owes me , so freak you .
The wife 's a nag and the kid 's freaking up .
I don't have sex `cause i can't get it up .
I 'm always rude .
I 've got a bad attitude .
The world owes , so freak you .
Don't make me ask again please .
Put it down your throat until it makes you cough .
Nibble on my dick like a rat does cheese .
Well you 're from the south your a special kind of girl .
Put my nuts in your mouth just like you was a squirrel .
Work on the shaft , cradle on the balls .
Baby just dont bite it , get it on get it on .
Suck my dick until your lips fall off .
Don't make me ask again please .
Put it down your throat until it makes you cough .
Nibble on my dick like a rat does cheese .
Well why don't you go down and a hook a brother up ?
Swallow it on down or spit it in a cup .
Wipe it on your t-shirt let it dribble down your chin .
Smoke a couple Newports and suck that dick again .
Suck my dick until your lips fall off .
Don't make me ask again please .
Put it down your throat until it makes you cough .
Nibble on my dick like a rat does cheese .
Compulsive habits that never seem to die
Your breath is taken up all the air
Your teeth are rotting to black holes in your head
Well reality is due What you say just can't be true
When the story is streched and so far fetched
That you 're lacking an excuse
You Lied
Your mother allowed you for just one white lie
But now she 's dead , and she left you with a problem
Pinocchio has pierced your tongue
Your nose is growin ' into the 3rd dimension
Well reality is due What you say just can't be true
When the story is stretched and so far fetched
That you 're lacking an excuse
You Lied
Well reality is due What you say just can't be true
When the story is stretched and so far fetched
That you 're lacking an excuse
You Lied
Light weights step to the side when we come in
Feel it in your chest the syllables get pumping
People on the street they panic and start running
Words on loose leaf sheet complete coming
I jump in my mind and summon the rhyme , I 'm dumping
Healing the blind I promise to let the sun in
Sick of the dark ways we march to the drum and
Jump when they tell us that they wanna see jumping
Fuck that I wanna see some fists pumping
Risk something , take back what 's yours
Say something that you know they might attack you for
Cause I 'm sick of being treated like I have before
Like it 's stupid standing for what I 'm standing for
Like this war 's really just a different brand of war
Like it doesn't cater the rich and abandon poor
Like they understand you in the back of the jet
When you can't put gas in your tank
These fuckers are laughing their way to the bank and cashing the check
Asking you to have compassion and have some respect
For a leader so nervous in an obvious way
Stuttering and mumbling for nightly news to replay
And the rest of the world watching at the end of the day
In their living room laughing like " what did he say ? "
[ Chorus ]
Amen
[ End Chorus ]
In my living room watching but I am not laughing
Cause when it gets tense I know what might happen
World is cold the bold men take action
Have to react or get blown into fractions
Ten years old it 's something to see
Another kid my age drug under a jeep
Taken and bound and found later under a tree
I wonder if he had thought the next one could be me
Do you see the soldiers they 're out today
They brush the dust with bullet proof vests away
It 's ironic at times like this you pray
But a bomb blew the mosque up yesterday
There 's bombs in the buses , bikes , roads
Inside your market , your shops , your clothes
My dad he 's got a lot of fear I know
But enough pride inside not to let that show
My brother had a book he would hold with pride
A little red cover with a broken spine
On the back , he hand-wrote a quote inside
When the rich wage war it 's the poor who die
Meanwhile , the leader just talks away
Stuttering and mumbling for nightly news to replay
And the rest of the world watching at the end of the day
both scared and angry like " what did he say ? "
[ Chorus ]
Amen
With hands held high into a sky so blue
As the ocean opens up to swallow you
With hands held high into a sky so blue
As the ocean opens up to swallow you
With hands held high into a sky so blue
As the ocean opens up to swallow you
With hands held high into a sky so blue
As the ocean opens up to swallow you
With hands held high into a sky so blue
As the ocean opens up to swallow you
With hands held high into a sky so blue
As the ocean opens up to swallow you
[ End Chorus ]
Through the windows , up the stairs
Chilling rain
Like an ocean everywhere
[ Chorus ]
Don't want to reach for me do you
I mean nothing to you
The little things give you away
And now there will be no mistaking
The levees are breaking
All you 've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you
And six feet under water
I
Do
[ End Chorus ]
Hope decays
Generations disappear
Washed away
As a nation simply stares
[ Chorus ]
Don't want to reach for me do you
I mean nothing to you
The little things give you away
But there will be no mistaking
The levees are breaking
All you 've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you
And six feet under water
I
Do
All you 've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you
And six feet under ground now
I
Now I do
[ End Chorus ]
[ Brad 's Guitar Solo ]
Little things give you away
( Little things give you away )
All you 've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you
( Little things give you away )
All you 've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you
( Little things give you away )
All you 've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you
( Little things give you away )
All you 've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you
( Little things give you away )
All you 've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you
( Little things give you away )
All you 've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you
( Little things give you away )
All of her favorite things
Sold the rest at a rainy yard sale
Big plans and leaving friends and
A westbound sign
Weighed out
Her choices on a scale
Prevailing nothing made sense
Just transportation and a
Blank decision .
She 's taking off
Taking off .
No time and no copping out
She 's burning daylight and petrol
Blacked out the rearview mirror
Heading westward on
Strung out
On confusion road
And ten minute nervous breakdowns
Xanex a beer for thought
And she determined .
She 's taking off
Taking off .
Is it salvation
Or an escape from discontent
Will she find her name
In the California cement
Punched out of the grind
That punched her one too many times .
Is tragedy 2000 miles away
She 's taking off
Taking off .
Come back together
Put yourself on the band
And see us forever
Could you , could you come home ?
Come home forever
Sure there are things in the band ?
Keep us together
Cos you 're the one I love
You 're the one I love
Ahhhh , ahhhh .
Could you , could you come home ?
Could you tell me whatever ?
Tie youself to a mast ?
It 's now or it 's never
Could it tear us apart ?
It 'll soon be forever
It 's gonna tear us apart
Keep us together
You 're the one I love
Ahhh ahhh
You 're the one I love
( yeah yeah you 're the one )
( oooooooooooooo x2 )
You 're the one I love
Touches me just when I
Thought that it would end
Oh but then again it seems
Much more than that but
I 'm not sure exactly what you 're thinking
Well , I toss and turn all night
Thinking of your ways of effection
But to find that it 's not different at all
I throw away my past mistakes
And contemplate my future
That 's when I say .
What the hey !
Would I last forever
You and I together , hand and hand
We run away ( far away )
I 'm in for nasty weather
But I 'll take whatever you can
give that comes my way ( far away )
Here we go again , infatuation
Touches me just when I
Thought that it would end
Oh but then again it seems
Much more than that but
I 'm not sure exactly what you 're thinking
Oh but then again it seems
Much more than that but
I 'm not sure exactly what you 're thinking
Well , I toss and turn all night
Thinking of your ways of effection
But to find that it 's not different at all
I throw away my past mistakes
And contemplate my future
That 's when I say .
What the hey !
Would I last forever
You and I together , hand and hand
We run away ( far away )
I 'm in for nasty weather
But I 'll take whatever you can
give that comes my way ( far away )
Well , I toss and turn all night
Thinking of your ways of effection
But to find that it 's not different at all
I throw away my past mistakes
And contemplate my future
That 's when I say .
What the hey !
Would I last forever
You and I together , hand and hand
We run away ( far away )
I 'm in for nasty weather
But I 'll take whatever you can
give that comes my way ( far away )
And you never should have
But you never should have
But don't break your back
If you ever see this
But don't answer life
In a bullet proof vest
With the windows all closed
I 'll be doing my best
I 'll see you sitting
In a telescope lens
And when all you want is friends
I see you sitting
So they came for you
They came snapping at your heels
They come snapping at your heels
But don't break your back
If you ever say this
But don't answer life
In a bullet proof vest
With the windows all closed
I 'll be doing my best
I 'll see you sitting
In a telescope lens
And when all you want is friends
I see you sitting
And oh , you lost your trust
No , don't lose your trust
And oh , you lost your trust
But you paid me no attention , do you .
I know you don't listen to me .
' cause you say you see straight me , don't you .
On and on from the moment I wake ,
To the moment I sleep ,
I 'll be there by your side ,
Just you try and stop me ,
I 'll be waiting in line ,
Just to see if you care .
Did she want me to change
But I change for good .
And I want you to know .
But you always get your way ,
I wanted to say ,
[ Chorus ]
Don't you Shiver Shiver , Shiver
I 'll always be waiting for you ,
So you know how much I need ya ,
But you never even see me , do you
And this is my final chance of getting you .
On and on from the moment I wake .
Did she want me to change .
[ Chorus ]
Sing it loud and clear .
I 'll always be waiting for you . [ x3 ]
Yeah I 'll always be waiting for you .
And it 's you I see , but you don't see me .
And it 's you I hear , so loud and clear .
I sing it loud and clear .
And I 'll always be waiting for you ,.
So I look in your direction ,
But you pay me no attention ,
And you know how much I need you ,
But you never even seen me .
My head is standing underneath my puke ,
So make it stop , I 'm getting off .
Make it stop , I 'm getting off .
Sedatives and dizzy spells
And feeling like a salad in my puke ,
So make it stop , I 'm getting off .
Make it stop I 'm getting off .
Well , slipped into a coma once again .
Where 's my organ donor
Lend a hand .
So when you think you 're all alone ,
No one 's left to come around ,
Drop like flies and empathize ,
Cause I know that I will someday ,
And I know that I will suffocate ,
Suffocate , suffocate , suffocate .
One night stands and cheap regrets ,
I take another drag off of my cigarette ,
So stop , I 'm getting off .
Make it stop , I 'm getting off .
One last stop for one track mind ,
Just give me shelter , give me give me something .
Make it stop , I 'm getting off .
Make it stop , I 'm getting off .
Well , slipped into a coma once again .
Where 's my organ donor
Lend a hand .
So when you think you 're all alone ,
No one 's left to come around ,
Drop like flies and empathize ,
Cause I know that I will someday ,
And I know that I will suffocate ,
Suffocate , suffocate , suffocate .
So when you think you 're all alone ,
No one 's left to come around ,
Drop like flies and empathize ,
Cause I know that I will someday ,
And I know that I will suffocate ,
Cause I know that I will someday ,
And I know that I will suffocate ,
Suffocate , suffocate , suffocate .
But the words would come out wrong
Oh if you only knew
The way I felt for so long
I know that we 're worlds apart
But I just don't seem to care
These feelings in my heart
Only with you I want to share
The first time I caught a glimpse of you
Then my thoughts were only of you
I hope that when time goes by
You will think the same about me
Many nights awake I lie
I only wish that you could see
I know that we 're only friends
I hope this feeling never ends
If I could only hold you
It 's the only thing I want to do .
The first time I caught a glimpse of you
Then my thoughts were only of you
Bottom to top I stop
At the core I 've forgotten
In the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety
The picture 's there
The memory won't escape me
We 're stuck in a place so dark , you could hardly see
A manner of matter that splits with the words I breathe
And as the rain drips acidic questions around me
I block out the sight of the powers that be
Duck away into the darkness , times up
I wind up in a rusted world with eyes shut
So tight that it blurs into the world of pretend
And the eyes ease open and it 's dark again
From the top to the bottom
Bottom to top I stop
At the core I 've forgotten
In the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety
The picture 's there
The memory won't escape me
But why should I care
In the memory you 'll find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up
Listen to the sound , dizzy from the ups and downs
And nauseated by the polluted rock that 's all around
Watchin the wheels of cars that pass
I look past to the last of the light and the long shadows it casts
A window grows and captures the eye
And cries out yellow light as it passes me by
And a young , shadowy figure sits in front of a box
Inside a building of rocks with antennas on top
Now , nothing can stop in this land of the pain
The same lose , not knowing they were part of the game
While the insides change , the box stays the same
And the figure inside could bear anybody 's name
The memories I keep are from a time like then
I put on my paper so I could come back to them
Someday I 'm hopin to close my eyes and pretend
That this crumpled up paper can be perfect again
From the top to the bottom
Bottom to top I stop
At the core I 've forgotten
In the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety
The picture 's there
The memory won't escape me
I 'm here at the podium talking , the ceremonial offerings
Dedicated to urban dysfunctional offspring
What 's happened
City governments are eternally napping
Trapped in greedy covenants , causin urban collapsing
Bullets that scar souls , with dark holds , get more than your car stole
Some hearts be blacker than charcoal
For real , this society 's deprivation depends not on our differences , but the separation within
No preparation is made , limited age , minimum wage
Livin in a tenement cage for innocent pay
Tragedy within a parade
The darkness overspreads like permanent plauge
I 'm the forgotten
In the memory you 'll find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up
May I please speak with you
I 'm having troubles with control
And it 's all because of you
Today I kept on falling down
I thought it was the street
So I look down at my shoes
They were on the wrong feet
I find it hard to be myself
( Can you please explain )
I do not think that it 's my health
( You 're the one to blame )
You 're the one I wish I had
And now my girlfriend is getting mad
( I cannot call this sane )
Today as I was walking down
You bumped into me
You said " excuse me " and walked away
As I dropped to my knees
I prayed to the being in the sky
That my parents told me of
I asked about you but no reply
No clues about your love !
I find it hard to be myself
( Can you please explain )
I do not think that it 's my health
( You 're the one to blame )
My girlfriend left me on the phone
I 'm pathetically left here alone
( I cannot call this sane )
Can we find a way
So that you can stay
I think I 'm gonna Pop
I find it hard to be myself
( Can you please explain )
I do not think that it 's my health
( You 're the one to blame )
You 're the one I wish I had
And now my girlfriend is getting mad
( I cannot call this sane )
Can we find a way
So that you can stay
I think I 'm gonna Pop
Has found its way to me
It 's out , and it 's out , and it 's out
Making me cry
I think that I will not move
I 'm too scared to leave my room
But I won't be defeated , oh no
What if cards don't go my way ?
Then it 's sure to spoil my day
But in voices loud and clear
You say to me it 's only superstition
It 's only your imagination
It 's only your other things that you feel
And the things from which you can't escape
Keep clean for the thousandth time
Stand still and wait in line
So nobody 's better than others , oh no
What if cards don't go my way ?
Then it 's sure to spoil my day
But in voices loud and clear
You say to me it 's only superstition
It 's only your imagination
It 's only your other things that you feel
And the things from which you can't explain
And it 's making me cry
And I 'm slipping away , love
I 'm slipping away
It 's only superstition
Only your imagination
It 's only superstition
Only superstition
Reminds me of the times we shared .
Makes me wish that you were here .
Now it seems I 've forgotten my purpose in this life .
All the songs have been erased .
Guess I 've learned from my mistakes .
Open the past and present .
Now and we are there .
Story to tell and I am listening .
Open the past and present .
And the future too .
It 's all I 've got and I 'm giving it up to you .
Loose ends tied in knots .
Leaving a lump down in my throat .
Gagging on a souvenir .
Lodged to fill another year .
Drag it on and on until my skin is ripped to shreds .
Leaving myself wide open .
Living out a sacrifice .
If you got no one and I 've got no place to go , would it be alright
Could it be alright
I 've been trying hard to reach you , cause I don't know what to do
Oh brother I can't believe it 's true
I 'm so scared about the future and I wanna talk to you
Oh I wanna talk to you
You can take a picture of something you see
In the future where will I be ?
You can climb a ladder up to the sun
Or write a song nobody has sung
Or do something that 's never been done
Are you lost or incomplete ?
Do you feel like a puzzle , you can't find your missing piece ?
Tell me how do you feel ?
Well I feel like they 're talking in a language I don't speak
And they 're talking it to me
So you take a picture of something you see
In the future where will I be ?
You can climb a ladder up to the sun
Or a write a song nobody has sung
Or do something that 's never been done
Do something that 's never been done
So you don't know were you 're going , and you wanna talk
And you feel like you 're going where you 've been before
You tell anyone who 'll listen but you feel ignored
Nothing 's really making any sense at all
Let 's talk , let 's ta-a-alk
i woke up in a dream today
to the cold and the static
put my cold feet on the floor
forgot all about yesterday
remembering i 'm pretending
to be where i 'm not anymore
a little taste of hipocrisy
and i 'm left in the wake
of the mistake slow to react
even though you 're so close to me
you 're still so distant
and i can't bring you back
it 's true the way i feel
was promised by your face
the sound of your voice
painted on my memories
even if you 're not with me
i 'm with you
you now i see keeping everything inside
with you
you now i see even when i close my eyes
with you
you now i see keeping everything inside
with you
you now i see even when i close my eyes
i hit you and you hit me back
we fall to the floor
the rest of the day stands still
fine line between this and that
but when things go wrong
i pretend that the past isn't real
i 'm trapped in this memory
and i 'm left in the wake
of the mistake slow to react
even though you 're close to me
you 're still so distant
and i can't bring you back
it 's true the way i feel
was promised by your face
the sound of your voice
painted on my memories
even if you 're not with me
i 'm with you
you now i see keeping everything inside
with you
you now i see even when i close my eyes
with you
you now i see keeping everything inside
with you
you now i see even when i close my eyes
no , no i won't let you control my fate
while i 'm holding the weight
of the world on my conscience
no , i won't just sit here and wait
wear your options you 're making a fool of me
no , you didn't dare try to say
that you don't care solemnly swear
not to follow me there
no , it ain't like me to beg on my knees
oh , please , oh baby , please
that 's not how i 'm doing things
no i 'm not upset
no i 'm not angry
i know love is love
love sometimes it pains me
with or without you
i 'll always be with you
you 'll never forget me
i 'm keeping you with me
no i won't let you take me to the
end of my rope while you burn
and torture my soul
no i 'm not your puppet and
no , no , no i won't let you go
no matter how far we 've come
i can't wait to see tomorrow
no matter how far we 've come
i , i can't wait to see tomorrow
with you
you now i see keeping everything inside
with you
you now i see even when i close my eyes
with you
you now i see keeping everything inside
with you
you now i see even when i close my eyes
Up on the boulevard like a zip gun on parade
Light of a silhouette
He 's insubordinate
Coming at you on the count of 1 , 2 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 !
My name is Jimmy and you better not wear it out
Suicide commando that your momma talked about
King of the forty theives
And I 'm here to represent
That needle in the vein of the establishment
I 'm the patron saint of the denial
With an angel face and a taste for suicidal
Cigarettes and ramen and a little bag of dope
I am the son of a bitch and Edgar Allen Poe
Raised in the city under a halo of lights
The product of war and fear that we 've been victimized
I 'm the patron saint of the denial
With an angel face and a taste for suicidal
ARE YOU TALKING TO ME ?
I 'll give you something to cry about .
ST . JIMMY !
My name is St. Jimmy I 'm a son of a gun
I 'm the one that 's from the way outside
I 'm a teenage assassin executing some fun
In the cult of the life of crime .
I really hate to say it but I told you so
So shut your mouth before I shoot you down old boy
Welcome to the club and give me some blood
And the resident leader at the lost and found
It 's comedy and tragedy
It 's St. Jimmy
And that 's my nameeeeeee . and don't wear it out !
I think I 'm falling off
Into a state of regression
The expiration date
Rapidly coming up
It 's leaving me behind to rank
Always move forward
Going " straight " will get you nowhere
There is no progress
Evolution killed it all
I found my place in nowhere
I 'm taking one step sideways
Leading with my crutch
Got a freaked up equilibrium
Count down from 9 to 5
Hooray ! We 're gonna die !
Blessed into our extinction
Always move forward
Going " straight " will get you nowhere
There is no progress
Evolution killed it all
I found my place in nowhere
Always move forward
Going " straight " will get you nowhere
There is no progress
Evolution killed it all
I found my place in nowhere
I 'm saying everything I 've said before
All these words they make no sense
I find bliss in ignorance
Less I hear the less you 'll say
But you 'll find that out anyway
Just like before .
Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I 'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
Cause I 'm one step closer to the edge
And I 'm about to break
I find the answers aren't so clear
Wish I could find a way to disappear
All these thoughts they make no sense
I find bliss in ignorance
Nothing seems to go away
Over and over again
shut up when I 'm talking to you
( Everyone feels so far away from me )
Heavy thoughts sift through dust
And the lies
( Trying not to break ,
But I 'm so tired of this deceit
Everytime I try to make myself
Get back up on my feet
All I ever think about is this
All the tiring and time between
And how trying to put my trust in you
Just takes so much out of me )
[ Chorus :]
Take everything from the inside
And throw it all away
' Cause I swear , for the last time
I won't trust myself with you
Tension is building inside , steadily
( Everyone feels so far away from me )
Heavy thoughts forcing their way , out of me
( Trying not to break
But I 'm so tired of this deceit
Everytime I try to make myself
Get back up on my feet
All I ever think about is this
All the tiring and time between
And how , trying to put my trust in you
Just takes so much out of me )
[ Chorus : Repeat ]
I wont waste myself on you !
You ! [ x2 ]
Waste myself on you !
You ! [ x2 ]
[ Chorus : Repeat ( x2 )]
You ! [ x3 ]
You 're running out of gas .
Your sympathy will get you left behind .
Sometimes you 're at your best , when you look the worst .
Do you feel washed up , like piss going down the drain
Pressure cooker pick my brain and tell me I 'm insane .
I 'm so freaking happy I could cry .
Every joke can have its truth and now the joke 's on you .
I never knew you were such a funny guy .
Oh nice guys finish last , when you are the outcast .
Don't pat yourself on the back , you might break your spine .
Living on command .
You 're shaking lots of hands .
Kissing up and bleeding all your trust , taking what you need .
Bit the hand that feeds .
You kill your memory
And I wanna feel like that
Little white shadows , blink and miss them
Part of a system I am
If you ever feel like something 's missing ?
Things you 'll never understand
Little white shadows , sparkle and glisten
Part of a system plan
When all our fears are waking up
All the space I 'm taking up
All this sound is breaking up
Ohhhh .
Maybe you get what you wanted
Maybe you stumbled upon it
Everything you ever wanted
In a permanent state
Maybe you 'll know when you see it
Maybe if you say it , you 'll mean it
And when you find it , you keep it
In a permanent state
A permanent state
When I was a young boy
I tried to listen
Don't you wanna feel like that ?
We 're part of the human race and
All of the stars and the outer space
We 're part of the system plan
When all our fears are waking up
And all the space , I 'm taking up
I said I cannot hear you , you 're breaking up
Maybe you get what you wanted
Maybe you stumbled upon it
Everything you ever wanted
In a permanent state
Maybe you 'll know when you see it
Maybe if you say it , you 'll mean it
And when you find it , you keep it
In a permanent state
A permanent state
Swim out on a sea of faces ,
The tide of the human races ,
An answer now is what I need .
See it in a new sun rising
See it break on your horizon
Oh , come on love , stay with me .
Doesn't attack me but she did once
Intoxications in her veins
Sweet young boy plays with her brain
Lydia 'll bring to life
What are your chance not to oblige
Putting his hand on her thigh
Ability has now been ripped
Take it away , I 'd rather sit
Sweet children , sweet children , sweet children Remember when
Johnny 's playing fun and games ,
or else he 's in the storage shed
Running from the light of day ,
or maybe lie and celebrate
The funny circus from his head
Follow me if you understand
I 'll trick her so she 'll do it
Then I 'll sing and now we run
Sweet children , sweet children , sweet children Remember when
I said , how do you live as a fugitive
Down here where I cannot see so clear
I said , what do I know
Show me the right way to go
And the spies came out of the water
But you 're feeling so bad cos you know
But the spies hide out in every corner
But you can't touch them no
Cos they 're all spies
They 're all spies
I awake to see that no one is free
We 're all fugitives
Look at the way we live
Down here I cannot sleep from fear no
I said which way do I turn
I forget everything I learned
But the spies came out of the water
But you 're feeling so bad cos you know
But the spies hide out in every corner ,
But you can't touch them no
Cos they 're all spies they 're all spies
And if we don't hide here
They 're going to find us
If we don't hide now
They 're going to catch us where we sleep
And if we don't hide here
They 're going to find us
And the spies came out of the water
And you 're feeling so good cos you know
That those spies hide out in every corner
They can't touch you no
Cos they 're just spies
They 're just spies
She 's a saint
She 's salt of the earth
And she 's dangerous
She 's a rebel
Vigilante
Missing link on the brink
Of destruction
From Chicago to Toronto
She 's the one that they
Call old whatsername
She 's the symbol
of resistance
and she 's holding on my
heart like a hand grenade
Is she dreaming
what I 'm thinking
Is she the mother of all bombs
gonna detonate
Is she trouble
like I 'm trouble
make it a double
twist of fate
or a melody that
She sings the revolution
the dawning of our lives
she brings this liberation
that I just can't define
nothing comes to mind
[ x2 ]
She 's a rebel
She 's a saint
She 's salt of the earth
And she 's dangerous
She 's a rebel
Vigilante
Missing link on the brink
Of destruction
She 's a rebel
She 's a saint
She 's salt of the earth
And she 's dangerous
She 's a rebel
Vigilante
Missing link on the brink
Of destruction
She 's a rebel , She 's a rebel , She 's a rebel , And she 's dangerous
[ x2 ]
A thrill seeker making deals
Suger city urchin wasting time
Town of lunatics
Begging for another fix
Turning tricks for speedballs one more night
Making your rounds once again
Turning and empty handed
Bumming a ride
Burning day light
Last up at down
Tight Wad Hill
Drugstore hooligan
Another white trash mannequin
On display to rot up on the hill
Living out a lie
But having the time of his life
Hating every minute of his existence
freaked without a kiss again and dragged it through the mud .
Yelling at brick walls and punching windows made of stone .
The worry rock has turned to dust and fallen on our pride .
A knocked down dragged out fight .
Fat lips and open wounds .
Another wasted night and no one will take the fall .
Where do we go from here
And what did you do with the directions
Promise me no dead end streets
And I 'll guarantee we 'll have the road .
Upon which I stand
And I come here to talk
I hope you understand
The green eyes
Yeah the spotlight
Shines upon you
And how could
Anybody
Deny you
I came here with a load
And it feels so much lighter
Now I 've met you
Honey you should know
I could never go on
Without you
Green eyes
Honey you are the sea
Upon which I float
And I came here to talk
I think you should know
The green eyes
You 're the one that I wanted to find
And anybody who tried to deny you ,
Must be out of their minds
' Cause I came here with a load
And it feels so much lighter since I met you
Honey you should know ,
That I could never go on
Without you
Green eyes , green eyes , ohohoh .
Honey you are a rock
Upon which I stand .
Time grabs you by the wrist , directs you where to do .
So make the best of this test , and don't ask why .
It 's not a question , but a lesson learned in time .
It 's something unpredictable , but in the end is right .
I hope you had the time of your life .
So take the photographs , and still frames in your mind .
Hang it on a shelf of good health and good time .
Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial .
For what it 's worth , it was worth all the while .
I hope you had the time of your life .
I hope you had the time of your life .
Performed by Chester Bennington Of Linkin Park
You fell away , what more can I say ?
The feelings evolved , I won't let it out
I can't replace your screaming face
Feeling the sickness inside
Chorus
Why won't you die ?
Your blood in mine
We 'll be fine
Then your body will be mine
So many words can't describe my face
This feelings evolved , so soon to break out
I can't relate to a happy state
Feeling the blood run inside
Chorus
Why is everything so fucking hard for me ?
Keep me down to what you think I should be
Must you tempt me and provoke the ministry ?
Keep on trying I 'm not dying so easily
( I will not die ) 3x
Why is everything so fucking hard for me ? 2x
Chorus2x
And brought it back to me
And that 's what made me see
Where I was going wrong
You put me on a shelf
And kept me for yourself
I can only blame myself
You can only blame me
And I could write a song
A hundred miles long
Well , that 's where I belong
And you belong with me
And I could write it down
Or spread it all around
Get lost and then get found
Or swallowed in the sea
You put me on a line
And hung me out to dry
And darling that 's when I
Decided to go to see you
You cut me down to size
And opened up my eyes
Made me realize
What I could not see
And I could write a book
The one they 'll say that shook
The world , and then it took
It took it back from me
And I could write it down
Or spread it all around
Get lost and then get found
And you 'll come back to me
Not swallowed in the sea
Ooh .
And I could write a song
A hundred miles long
Well , that 's where I belong
And you belong with me
The streets you 're walking on
A thousand houses long
Well , that 's where I belong
And you belong with me
Oh what good is it to live
With nothing left to give
Forget but not forgive
Not loving all you see
Oh the streets you 're walking on
A thousand houses long
Well that 's where I belong
And you belong with me
Not swallowed in the sea
You belong with me
Not swallowed in the sea
Yeah , you belong with me
Not swallowed in the sea
Of getting older all the time
I ask you now , what does this mean
Are these problems just in my mind
Things are easy when you 're a child
But now these pressures have dropped on my head
The length I 've gone are just long miles
Would they be shorter if I were dead
Every time I look in my past
I always wish I was there
I wish my youth would forever last
Why are these times so unfair
Look at my friends and see what they 've done
Ask myself why they had to change
I like them better when they were young
Now all these times are rearranged
I look down and stand there and cry
Nothing ever will be the same
The sun is rising , now I ask why
The clouds now fall and here comes the rain
Every time I look in my past
I always wish I was there
I wish my youth would forever last
Why are these times so unfair
Every night I dream the same dream
Of getting older all the time
I ask you now , what does this mean
Are these problems just in my mind
Things are easy when you 're a child
But now these pressures have dropped on my head
The length I 've gone are just long miles
Would they be shorter if I were dead
Every time I look in my past
I always wish I was there
I wish my youth would forever last
Why are these times so unfair
Turn up the static left of the state of the nation
Turn up the flame , step on the gas
Burning the flag at half mast
She 's a rebel 's forgotten son
An export of the revolution
She is the first voice of the last ones in the line
She 'll drag the lake to keep the vendetta alive
Bring in the head of the government
The dog ate the document
Somebody shot the President
And no one knows where Maria went
Maria , Maria , Maria ,
Where did you go
Be careful what you 're offering
Your breath lacks the conviction
Drawing the line in the dirt
Because the last decision
. is no .
I close both blinds and turn away
Sometimes solutions aren't so simple
Sometimes good bye 's the only away
[ Chorus ]
And the sun will set for you
The sun will set for you
And the shadow of the day
Will embrace the world in grey
And the sun will set for you
[ End Chorus ]
In cards and flowers on your window
Your friends all plead for you to stay
Sometimes beginnings aren't so simple
Sometimes good bye 's the only way
[ Chorus ]
And the sun will set for you
The sun will set for you
And the shadow of the day
Will embrace the world in grey
And the sun will set for you
And the shadow of the day
Will embrace the world in grey
And the sun will set for you
And the shadow of the day
Will embrace the world in grey
And the sun will set for you
[ End Chorus ]
We here
We here at the sound institute have invented a reliable audio-weapons system
Let 's
Let 's try
Let 's try something else
Folks , we have a very special guest for you tonight
Break it down
Calling all freaks
Using the waves of sound
The true master paralyzes his opponent
Leaving him vulnerable to attack
Mister Hahn
When I do no wrong ,
I am cured , when I 'm by your side ,
I 'm alright , alright .
I am safe when I am with you ,
And I feel warm , if you want me to ,
I am cured , when I 'm by your side .
I 'm alright .
Careful where you stand ,
Careful where you lay your head ,
It 's true we 're always looking out for one another .
I feel safe , when I am with you ,
I feel warm , when you want me to ,
I am cured when you are around .
I 'm alright .
Careful where you stand ,
Careful where you lay your head ,
It 's true we 're always looking out for one another .
So I like a quiet time please ,
Yeah , I like a quiet time .
Careful where you stand ,
Now , careful where you stand
In an ordinary world
And she cant seem to get away
He lacks the courage in his mind
Like a child left behind
Like a pet left in the rain
She 's all alone again
Wiping the tears from her eyes
Some days he feels like dying
She gets so sick of crying
She sees the mirror of herself
An image she wants to sell
To anyone willing to buy
He steals the image in her kiss
From her hearts apocalypse
From the one called whatsername
She 's all alone again
Wiping the tears from her eyes
Some days he feels like dying
She gets so sick of crying
She 's all alone again
Wiping the tears from her eyes
Some days he feels like dying
Some days it 's not worth trying
Now that they both are finding
She gets so sick of crying
She 's an Extraordinary girl
an Extraordinary girl
I think that maybe the curtains are closing on me
But I wake up ; yes I wake up smiling
Sometimes I feel the chance is surprising
Surprisingly good to be moving around
So I wake up ; yes I wake up smiling
So what ? I feel fine
I 'm ok ; I 've seen the lighter side of life
I 'm alright , I feel good
So I 'll go and I 'll try to start moving
Sometimes I wake up and I 'm falling asleep
But I 've gotta get going
So much that I 'm wanting to do
But I wake up smiling
And this could be my last chance
Of saving my innocence
And this could be my last chance
No more keeping my feet on the ground
Sometimes I feel the chance is surprising
Surprisingly good to be moving around
And I move ; I wake up smiling
So what ? I feel fine
I feel okay ; I 've seen the lighter side of life
I 'm alright , I feel good
So I 'll go , well it 's time to start moving on
And this could be my last chance
Of saving my innocence
And this could be my last chance
So no more keeping my feet on the ground
I 'm not gonna keep on ; I 'm not gonna keep on moving
And I 'm not gonna keep on ; I 'm not gonna keep on moving
On the brink of self destruction
Widespread panic
Broken glass inside my head
Bleeding down these thoughts of
Anguish . mass confusion
The world is a sick machine
Breeding a mass of shoot
With such a desolate conclusion
Fill the void with . I don't care
There 's a plague inside of me
Eating at my disposition
Nothing 's left
Torn out of reality
Into a state of no opinion
Limp with hate
The world is a sick machine
Breeding a mass of shoot
With such a desolate conclusion
Fill the void with . I don't care
I wanna jump out !
She screams in silence
A sullen riot penetrating through her mind
We .
Wait for a sign
To smash the silence with the brick of self-control
Are you locked up in a world
Thats been planned out for you
Are you feeling like a social tool without a use
Scream at me until my ears bleed
I 'm taking heed just for you
She .
She 's figured out
All her doubts were someone else 's point of view
We .
Walking up this time
To smash the silence with the brick of self-control
Are you locked up in a world
Thats been planned out for you
Are you feeling like a social tool without a use
Scream at me until my ears bleed
I 'm taking heed just for you
EHHHHHH , AHHHHHHHHHH !
Are you locked up in a world
Thats been planned out for you
Are you feeling like a social tool without a use
Scream at me until my ears bleed
I 'm taking heed just for you
Were lines that I couldn't change
I was lost , oh yeah
I was lost , I was lost
Crossed lines I shouldn't have crossed
I was lost , oh yeah
Yeah , how long must you wait for him
Yeah , how long must you pay for him
Yeah , how long must you wait for him
I was scared , I was scared
Tired and underprepared
But I wait for you
If you go , if you go
Leaving me here on my own
Well I wait for you
Yeah , how long must you wait for him
Yeah , how long must you pay for him
Yeah , how long must you wait for him
Please , please , please
Come on and sing to me
To me , me
Come on and sing it out , out , out
Come on and sing it now , now , now
Come on and sing it
In my place , in my place
Were lines that I couldn't change
I was lost , oh yeah
Oh yeah
Replacing this pain with something numb
It 's so much easier to go
Than face all this pain here all alone
Something has been taken
From deep inside of me
A secret , I 've kept locked away
No one can ever see
Wounds so deep , they never show
They never go away
Like moving pictures in my head
For years and years they 've played
If I could change I would
Take back the pain I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made I would
If I could stand up , and take the blame I would
If I could take all the shame to the grave I would
If I could change I would
Take back the pain I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made I would
If I could stand up and take the blame I would
I would take all my shame to the grave
It 's easier to run
Replacing this pain with something numb
It 's so much easier to go
Than face all this pain here all alone
Sometimes I remember
The darkness of my past
Bringing back these memories
I wish I didn't have
Sometimes I think of letting go
And never looking back
And never moving forward so
There 'd never be a past
If I could change I would
Take back the pain I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made I would
If I could stand up , and take the blame I would
If I could take all the shame to the grave I would
If I could change I would
Take back the pain I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made I would
If I could stand up , and take the blame I would
I would take all my shame to the grave
Just washing it aside
All of the helplessness inside
Pretending I don't feel misplaced
It 's so much simpler than change
It 's easier to run
Replacing this pain with something numb
It 's so much easier to go
Than face all this pain here all alone
It 's easier to run
If I could change I would
Take back the pain I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made
It 's easier to go
If I could change I would
Take back the pain I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made I would
If I could stand up , and take the blame I would
I would take all the shame to the grave
At the speed of light .
The star was brightly shining ,
Like a neon light .
It 's your favorite son .
A fixture on the talkshows ,
To the silver screen .
From here to Colorado ,
He 's a sex machine .
It 's your favorite son .
But isn't it a drag ?
Isn't it a drag ?
It 's pretty bloody sad ,
but isn't it a drag ?
A clean-cut All-American ,
Really ain't so clean .
His royal auditorium ,
Is a murder scene .
It 's your favorite son .
Oh , isn't it a drag ?
Isn't it a drag ?
It 's pretty bloody sad ,
but isn't it a drag ?
[ Bridge ]
Well no one says it 's fair .
Turn a teenage lush ,
To a millionaire .
Now where 's your fuckin ' champion ?
On a bed you laid .
He 's not the All-American ,
That you thought you paid .
It 's your favorite son .
But isn't it a drag ?
Uh , yeah
Why does it feel like night today
Something in here 's not right today
Why am I so uptight today
Paranoia 's all I got left
I don't know what stressed me first
Or how the pressure was fed
But I know just what it feels like
To have a voice in the back of my head
It 's like a face that I hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face that watches everytime I lie
A face that laughs everytime I fall
And watches everything
So , know that when it 's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is hearing me
Right underneath my skin
It 's like I 'm paranoid looking over my back
It 's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It 's like I can't stop what I 'm hearing within
It 's like a face inside that 's right beneath my skin
Hey , yo
Here we go again with the pain I feel isn't real
But in my mind , I find myself in places with names but not faces
My memory races at speeds
Hundred degrees
My sould bleeds , devil must 've planted the seed
Now it feels like my back 's against the wall
I 'm taking the fall
Whenever I call nobody 's responding at all
But I don't know who I can trust
The screaming my name
I need somebody to help me out of the frame
All I 'm trying to do is just master me
All I want to do is smoke a blas t-t o-beat
But something keeps talking to me
Consciously , responsibly , keeps haunting me from dusk ' til dawn
Everything has something for you
That voice inside of your head got you projecting paranoia
Cold sweat shining on your face
Exposing your purpose
And if I ripped off your skin I 'd probably find another person
There 's nothing worse than trying to bring yourself on back from the dead
So I advise you : listen to that voice in the back of your head
It 's like I 'm paranoid looking over my back
It 's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It 's like I can't stop what I 'm hearing within
It 's like a face inside that 's right beneath my skin
It 's like I 'm paranoid looking over my back
It 's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It 's like I can't stop what I 'm hearing within
It 's like a face inside that 's right beneath my skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin
The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me
The sun goes down
It 's like I 'm paranoid
I feel the light betray me
The sun goes down
Can't stop what I 'm hearing within
It 's like the face inside is right beneath my skin
It 's like I 'm paranoid looking over my back
It 's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It 's like I can't stop what I 'm hearing within
It 's like a face inside that 's right beneath my skin
It 's like I 'm paranoid looking over my back
It 's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It 's like I can't stop what I 'm hearing within
It 's like a face inside that 's right beneath my skin
Trapped inside a roll of disillusion
I found out what it takes to be a man
Well , Mom and Dad will never understand
Secrets collecting dust but never forget
SKELETONS come to LIFE in my closet
I found out what it takes to be a man
Well , Mom and Dad will never understand
WHAT 'S HAPPENING TO ME
Seventeen and COMING CLEAN for the first time
I finally figured out myself for the first time
I found out what it takes to be a man
Mom and Dad will never understand
WHAT 'S HAPPENING TO ME
Is love , sweet love
That 's the only thing that
There 's just too little of
What the world needs now
Is love , sweet love
That 's the only thing that
There 's just too little of
And when this x is still stuck in my head
But misled doing the things I do would make you never wanna come back
But an all front attack , so you could never run from that
Being trapped in this beau , some that I never wanted to do
But through it all you 've got to see that what I want to be
Is over the pen again letting it out of me
In the center of the day in the dream , seeing all my thoughts
Getting lost in between , realizing one that the way to the sea
And the killing and again are in the head with the screams
I wanna live in another place
Where no one can say that I live for them
I wanna be in the energy , not with the enemy
A place for my head
We 're gonna be crushed when it all falls apart
Going in the hollow , hoping that you won't know
The strain it puts to me , seeing what you 've done
And consequently I 've run away , just hitting again
Within the boundaries of an anguish
Want me to say this , but you 're dragging me down
Lost in the chaos being tossed around
Singing again to myself , a head full of hectic
Hope that some day you 'll regret this
Everything 's the wrong place , the wrong time
Adding to the panic of my confine
Singing again to myself , a head full of hectic
Hope that some day you 'll regret this
Everything 's the wrong place , the wrong time
Adding to the panic of my confine
I wanna live in another place
Where no one can say that I live for them
I wanna be in the energy , not with the enemy
A place for my head
You
Try to take the best of me
Go away
You
Try to take the best of me
Go away
You
Try to take the best of me
Go away
You
Try to take the best of me
GO AWAY
You
Try to take the best of me , go away
You
Try to take the best of me , go away
You
Try to take the best of me , go away
You
Try to take the best of me , go away
I wanna live in another place
Where no one can say that I live for them
Start seeing it 's not meant
To be for me
I wanna be in the energy , not with the enemy
A place for my head
SHUT !
UP !
WHY !
Singing again to myself , a head full of hectic
Hope that some day you 'll regret this
Everything 's the wrong place , the wrong time
Adding to the panic of my confine
Singing again to myself , a head full of hectic
Hope that some day you 'll regret this
Everything 's the wrong place , the wrong time
Adding to the panic of my confine
This is my December
This is my time of the year
This is my December
This is all so clear
Just wish that I didn't feel
Like there was something I missed
Just wish that I didn't feel
Like there was something I missed
This is my December
This is my snow-covered home
This is my December
This is me alone
And I
Just wish that I didn't feel
Like there was something I missed
And I
Take back all the things I said
To make you feel like that
And I
Just wish that I didn't feel
Like there was something I missed
And I
Take back all the things I said to you
And I 'd give it all away
Just to have somewhere to go to
Give it all away
To have someone to come home to
This is my December
These are my snow-covered trees
This is my December
This is all I need
And I
Just wish that I didn't feel
Like there was something I missed
And I
Take back all the things I said
To make you feel like that
And I
Just wish that I didn't feel
Like there was something I missed
And I
Take back all the things that I said to you
And I 'd give it all away
Just to have somewhere to go to
Give it all away
To have someone to come home to
This is my December
This is my time of the year
This is my December
This is all so clear
Give it all away
Just to have somewhere to go to
Give it all away
To have someone to come home to
Give it all away
Just to have somewhere to go to
Give it all away
To have someone to come home to
For me it 's only the beginning
I see my friends begin to age
A short countdown to what end
Call me irresponsible
Call me habitual
But when you think of me
Do you fill your head with schemes
Better think again
Cause no one knows
I don't want to cause no harm
But sometimes my actions hurt
Is there something I should find
To make plans for forever
Call me irresponsible
Call me habitual
But when you think of me
Do you fill your head with schemes
Better think again
Cause no one knows
Call me irresponsible
Call me habitual
But when you think of me
Do you fill your head with schemes
Better think again
Cause no one knows
Does it seem like all your memories fade
You soak up knowledge to fill the space
And still my answer remains .
I don't know
I think that maybe the curtains are closing on me ,
But I wake up ,
Yes I wake up ,
Smiling ,
Sometimes I feel the chance is surprising ,
Surprisingly good to be moving around ,
So I wake up ,
Yes I wake up ,
Smiling ,
So what ? I feel fine ,
I 'm OK , I 've seen the lighter side of life ,
I 'm alright , I feel good ,
So I 'll do , I 'll try to stop moving ,
Sometimes I wake up , when I 'm falling asleep ,
And I 've got to get going so much that I wanted to do ,
That I wake up ,
Smiling ,
And this could be my last chance ,
Of saving the human sense ,
And this could be my last chance ,
No more keeping my feet on the ground ,
Sometimes I feel oh the chance is surprising ,
Surprisingly good to be moving around ,
And I move ,
And I wake up ,
Smiling ,
So what ? I feel fine ,
I feel OK , I 've seen the lighter side of life ,
I 'm alright , I feel good ,
So I 'll do , well it 's time to stop moving ,
And this could be my last chance ,
Of saving the human sense ,
And this could be my last chance ,
No more keeping my feet on the ground ,
There 's nothing to keep me x4
I 'm burning up and out and growing BORED
In my smoked out BORING room
My hair is shagging in my eyes
Dragging my feet to hit the street tonight
To drive along these shoot town lights
I 'm not growing up
I 'm just burning out
And I stepped in line
to walk amongst the DEAD
A pathy has rained on me
Now I 'm feeling like a soggy dream
So close to drowning but I DON'T MIND
I 've lived inside this mental cave
Throw my emotions in the grave
heck , who needs them anyway
I 'm not growing up
I 'm just burning out
And I stepped in line
to walk amongst the DEAD
[ Repeat many times ]
Jigga what , Jigga who ?
You gon ' need a vocal in , right ?
Motherfuckers wanna act loco , hit em wit , numerous
shots with the fo'-fo '
Faggots wanna talk to Po 's , smoke em like cocoa
Fuck rap , coke by the boatload
Fuck dat , on the run-by , gun high , one eye closed
Left holes through some guy clothes
Stop your bullshittin , glock with the full clip
Motherfuckers better duck when the fool spit
One shot could make a nigga do a full flip
See the nigga layin shocked when the bullet hit
Oh hey ma , how you , know niggaz wanna buy you
But see me I wanna Fuck for Free like Akinyele
Now I gotta let her take this ride , make you feel it
inside your belly , if it 's tight get the K-Y Jelly
All night get you wide up inside the telly
Side to side , til you say Jay-Z you 're too much for me
I am a little bit of loneliness a little bit of disregard
Handful of complaints but I can't help the fact that everyone can see
these scars
I am what I want you to want what I want you to feel
But it 's like no matter what I do , I can't convince you , to just believe
this is real
So I let go , watching you , turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I 'm not
But I 'll be here ' cause you 're all that I got
Got a condo with nuttin but condoms in it
The same place where the rhymes is invented
So all I do is rap and sex , imagine how I stroke
See how I was flowin on my last cassette ?
Rapid-fire like I 'm blastin a Tec , never jam though
Never get high , never run out of ammo
Niggaz hatin n shit cause I slayed your bitch
You know your favorite , I know it made you sick
And now you 're , actin raw but you never had war
Don't know how to carry your hoe , wanna marry your hoe
Now she 's mad at me , causer Your Majesty , just happened to be
A pimp with a tragedy
She wanted , us to end , cause I fucked with friends
She gave me one more chance and I fucked her again
I seen her tears as she busted in , I said , " Shit .
there 's a draft , shut the door bitch and come on in ! "
I am a little bit insecure a little unconfident
Cause you don't understand I do what I can but sometimes I don't make
sense
I am what you never wanna say but I 've never had a doubt
It 's like no matter what I do I can't convince you for once just to hear
me out
So I let go watching you turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I 'm not
But I 'll be here ' cause you 're all that I 've got
I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored
No
Hear me out now
You 're gonna listen to me , like it or not
Right now
Hear me out now
You 're gonna listen to me , like it or not
Right now
I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored
I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored
I can't feel
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored
Time won't heal
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored
When I look into your eyes there 's nothing there to see
Nothing but my own mistakes staring back at me
Everything has to end
You 'll soon find that we 're out of time left to watch it all unwind
Everything falls apart
Even the people who never froun eventually break down
Everything has to end
You 'll soon find we 're out of time left to watch in all unwind
Everything falls apart
Even the people who never frown eventually break down
I 've lied to you
This is the last smile that I 'll fake for the sake of being with you
Everything falls apart even
Even the people who never frown eventually break down
Everything has to end
You 'll soon find we 're out of time left to watch it all unwind
The sake of being with you
Everything falls apart
Even the people who never frown eventually break down
The sacrifice is never knowing
Why I stayed with you
Just push away
No matter what you see
You 're still so blind to me
Even the people who never frown eventually break down
I 've tried , like you , to do everything you wanted to
This is the last time
That I 'll take the blame for the sake of being with you
Everything falls apart
Even the people who never frown eventually break down
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
Everything has to end
You 'll soon find we 're out of time left to watch it all unwind
The sacrifice is never knowing
Why I stay with you
Just push away
No matter what you see
You 're still so blind to me
Reverse psychology is failing miserably
It 's so hard to be left all alone
Telling you is the only chance for me
There is nothing left but to turn and face you
When I look into your eyes there 's nothing there to see
Nothing but my own mistakes staring back at me
Asking why
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
The sacrifice is never knowing
Why I stayed with you
Just push away
No matter what you see
You 're still so blind to me
Why I stayed with you
Just push away
No matter what you see
You 're still so blind to me
Before it starts , before I begin ?
How long before you decide ?
Before I know what it feels like ?
Where To , where do I go ?
If you never try , then you 'll never know .
How long do I have to climb ,
Up on the side of this mountain of mine ?
Look up , I look up at night ,
Planets are moving at the speed of light .
Climb up , up in the trees ,
every chance that you get ,
is a chance you seize .
How long am I gonna stand ,
with my head stuck under the sand ?
I 'll start before I can stop ,
before I see things the right way up .
All that noise , and all that sound ,
All those places I got found .
And birds go flying at the speed of sound ,
to show you how it all began .
Birds came flying from the underground ,
if you could see it then you 'd understand ?
Ideas that you 'll never find ,
All the inventors could never design .
The buildings that you put up ,
Japan and China all lit up .
The sign that I couldn't read ,
or a light that I couldn't see ,
some things you have to believe ,
but others are puzzles , puzzling me .
All that noise , and all that sound ,
All those places I got found .
And birds go flying at the speed of sound ,
to show you how it all began .
Birds came flying from the underground ,
if you could see it then you 'd understand ,
ah when you see it then you 'll understand ?
All those signs , I knew what they meant .
Some things you can invent .
Some get made , and some get sent ,
Ooh ?
Birds go flying at the speed of sound ,
to show you how it all began .
Birds came flying from the underground ,
if you could see it then you 'd understand ,
ah , when you see it then you 'll understand ?
I spun a web , it 's tangled up with me ,
And I lost my head ,
The thought of all the stupid things I said ,
O no what 's this
A spider web , and I 'm caught in the middle ,
I turned to run ,
The thought of all the stupid things I 've done ,
I never meant to cause you trouble ,
And I never meant to do you wrong ,
And I , well if I ever caused you trouble ,
O no , I never meant to do you harm .
O no I see ,
A spider web and it 's me in the middle ,
So I twist and turn ,
Here I am in love in a bubble ,
Singing , I never meant to cause you trouble ,
I never meant to do you wrong ,
And I , well if I ever caused you trouble ,
Although I never meant to do you harm .
They spun a web for me ,
They spun a web for me .
With all of your words flying over my head
Even more time gets wasted
In a daze
It should seem obvious to you
Your screams and cries are never going to work
And all of your time gets wasted
In my daze
And I 'm looking back now
At where I have gone wrong
And why I could not seem to get along
My interests are longing
To break from these chains
These chains that control
My future 's aim .
I sit in the state of a daydream
With all of your words flying over my head
Even more time gets wasted
In a daze
Maybe I 'm just too darn lazy
Or maybe I was just brainwashed to think that way
And all of your time gets wasted
In my daze
And I 'm looking back now
At where I have gone wrong
And why I could not seem to get along
My interests are longing
To break from these chains
These chains that control
My future 's aim .
I 'm looking-
back now at-
Where I have-
have gone wrong .
And why I -
could not seem-
Could not seem-
to get along .
And I 'm looking back now
At where I have gone wrong
And why I could not seem to get along
My interests are longing
To break from these chains
These chains that control
My future 's aim .
It 's been for quite some time
This time I 'm on to you
So where 's the other face
The face I heard before
Your head trip 's boring me
Let 's nuke the bridge we torched
2,000 times before
This time we 'll blast it all to heck
I 've had this burning in my guts now
for so long
My belly 's aching now to say
Stuck down in a rut of dislogic and smut
A side of you well hid
When it 's all said and done
it 's real and it 's been fun
But was it all REAL fun
Let 's nuke the bridge we torched
2,000 times before
This time we 'll blast it all to heck
I 've felt this burning in my guts now
for so long
My belly 's aching now to say
to say .
You 're just . a freak ,
I can't explain it ' cause I think you suck .
I 'm take-
-in pride
in telling you to freak off and die .
I 've had this burning in my guts now
for so long
My belly 's aching now to say
I 'm taking pleasure in the doubts
I 've passed to you
So listen up as you bite thisssss .
You 're just . a freak ,
I can't explain it ' cause I think you suck .
I 'm take-
-in pride
in telling you to freak off and die .
Goood niiiiiiiiight .
3 A.M. Where no one will be found
All I got in mind is a boons farm jug of wine
Smash the bottle in the parkin ' lot
But considerin ' our luck
We 'll get busted by the cops
Instead of sex , We 'll go to jail
Another Lesson learned and failed
Tie my hands above my head
Sing a song to me
Sing a song like what you said
' Cause they 're gonna murder me
They 're gonna take me down
Something .
I crumble down
Come spit at us
Come and throw your weight around
Come and fight with us
Come and rock me to the ground
' Cause they 're gonna murder me
They 're gonna take me down
Something .
I crumble down
So what can it possibly be ?
Oh what can it possibly be ?
Oh what can it possibly be ?
And he 's gonna win
Gonna take it for a hell ride anyway
He 's on your side
Gonna throw you aside
And let the vultures pick apart what 's left
Seems like everything was just a fraction of a second from being okay
So run and hide ' cause we 're all gonna die
And let the vultures pick apart what 's left
I 'll be back
He 's at it again
And it makes great television watching the world end
He 's at it again
He 's gonna win
Gonna take it for a joyride anyway
You 're standing in line , better make up your mind
And let the bastard pick apart what 's left of you
Seems like everything was just a fraction of being a dream
So run and hide ' cause we 're all gonna die
Let the government decide what 's left
I 'll be back
He 's at it again
And it makes great television watching the world end
I 'll be back
Walk around I see
Million possibilities
Well I know
Nowhere to go
And I can't comprehend
Things this real seems so pretend
I know . I don't know
But I 'll be back
I 'll be back
And it makes great television watching the world end
I 'll be back
And it makes great television watching the world end
I 'll be back
Experience has got her down
Look this direction , I know it 's not perfection , it 's just me .
I want to bring you up again now
Cause ' I 'm losing what 's left of my dignity
A small price to pay to see that you 're happy
Forget all the disappointments you have faced
Open up your worried world and let me in
Juliet 's crying cause now she 's realizing love can be
Filled with pain and distrust
I know I am crazy , and a bit lazy
But I will try to bring you up again now
Cause ' I 'm losing what 's left of my dignity
A small price to pay to see that you 're happy
Forget all the disappointments you have faced
Open up your worried world and let me in
Juliet 's crying cause now she 's realizing love can be
Filled with pain and distrust
I know I am crazy , and a bit lazy
But I will try to bring you up again some how
Cause ' I 'm losing what 's left of my dignity
A small price to pay to see that you 're happy
Forget all the disappointments you have faced
Open up your worried world and let me in
From the top
Shut up
Shut up when I 'm talking to you
Shut up
I 'm about to br
Wasn't that fun
Let 's try something else
Forty-five calibre killer from out of the filler
Definitely going to show y'all brothers how you not a gorilla
Smooth talking , fully automatic weapon concealer
Taste thriller , break thriller
Let 's hit ' em with the bounce filler
Filthy stinking , standing on solid ground
And still be sinking , submerging in the parks
Still be linking , plucked beef when it starts
To f*k your thinking , it 's not a mirage
I 'm in the motherf*king track , yo , from out the garage
With an if , you to duck , but it 's hard to dodge
In the back of the spine where my dawgs , they lie
Going to flip it straight up , ripping apart your squad
X-ecutioner style , cuts and blends like a syringe
Hanging you from each of your limbs
See me coming through the party hard without no bodyguard
Smoking something , stomping on each of you Tims
I 'm the B-to-the-L , the A , the C , King
And when it comes to planning
The thought to keep thinking , man
Shut up
It 's been three whole weeks since I have left your home
This sudden fear has left me trembling
' Cause now it seems that I am out here on my own
And I 'm feeling so alone
Pay attention to the cracked streets and the broken homes
Some call it slums and some call it nice
I want to take you through the waste land
That I like to call my home
Welcome to paradise
A gunshot rings out at the station
Another urchin snaps and left dead on his own
It makes me wonder why I 'm still here
For some strange reasons it 's now feeling like my home
And I 'm never gonna go
Dear mother , can you hear me laughing
It 's been six whole months since I have left your home
It makes me wonder why I 'm still here
For some strange reason it 's now feeling like my home
And I 'm never gonna go
You take the reprecussions
Headaches and anxieties
Advancing my frustrations
Rushings of my depression
Sacrifice everything
Waste with me into nothing
Well now you 're stuck with me
Stuck with me
Hand up your soul to my wrist
And I 'll vow my trust to you
Moving here I always thought
I realized you 've imagined
Rushings of my depression
Sacrifice everything
Waste with me into nothing
Well now you 're stuck with me
Stuck with me
Rushings of my depression
Sacrifice everything
Waste with me into nothing
Well now you 're stuck with me
Stuck with me
From the top to the bottom
Bottom to top I stop
At the core I 've forgotten
In the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety
The picture 's there
The memory won't escape me
We 're stuck in a place so dark
You can hardly see
The manner of matter that splits with the words I breathe
And as the rain drips acidic questions around me
I block out the sight and the powers that be
And duck away into the darkness
Times up
I wind up in a rusted world with eyes shut so tight that it blurs into the world of pretend
And the eyes ease open
And it 's dark again
From the top to the bottom
Bottom to top I stop
At the core I 've forgotten
In the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety
The picture 's there
The memory won't escape me
But why should I care
In the memory you 'll find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up
Listen to the sound
Dizzy from the ups and downs
I 'm nauseated by the polluted rock that 's all around
Watching the wheels of cars that pass
I look past to the last of the light and the long shadows it casts
A window grows and captures the eye
And cries out a yellow light as it passes me by
And a young shadowy figure sits in front of a box
Inside a building of rock with anntenaes on top , now
Nothing can stop in this land of the pain
The sane lose not knowing they were part of the game
And while the insides change
The box stays the same and the figure inside could bear anybody 's name
The memories I keep are from a time like then
I put on my paper so I could come back to them
Someday I 'm hoping to close my eyes and pretend
That this crumpled up paper can be perfect again
Yo , from the top to the bottom
Bottom to top I stop
At the core I 've forgotten
In the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety
The picture 's there
The memory won't escape me
I 'm here at this podium talking
The ceremonial offerings dedicated to urban dysfunctional offspinrg
What 's happening
City governments are eternally napping
Trapped in greedy covenants
Causing urban collapse
And bullets that scar souls with dark holds
Get more than your car stole , for real
This society 's deprivation depends now on our differences but the separation within
No preparation is made
Limited age and minimum wage
Living in a tenement cage for innocent pay
Tragedy within a parade
The darkness overspreads like a permenent plague
I 'm the forgotten
In the memory you 'll find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up
Content in the same old shtick again .
Now the routine 's turning to contention ,
Like a production line going over and over and over , roller
coaster .
Now I cannot speak , I lost my voice .
I 'm speechless and redundant .
' Cause I love you 's not enough .
I 'm lost for words .
Choreographed and lack of passion .
Prototypes of what we were .
Went full circle ' til I 'm nauseous .
Taken for granted now .
Now I waste it , faked it , ate it , now i hate it .
Now I cannot speak , I lost my voice .
I 'm speechless and redundant , ' cause I love you 's not enough .
I 'm lost for words , now I cannot speak .
I made my decision
To lead a path of self destruction
A slow progression
Killing my complexion
And it 's rotting out my teeth
I 'm on a roll
No self comtrol
I 'm blowing off steam with methamphetamine
Don't know what I want
That 's all that I 've got
And I 'm picking scabs off my face
Every hour my blood is turning sour
And my pulse is beating out of time
I found a treasure
filled with sick pleasure
And it sits on a thin white line
I 'm on a roll
No self comtrol
I 'm blowing off steam with methamphetamine
Don't know what I want
That 's all that I 've got
And I 'm picking scabs off my face
I 'm on a mission
I got no decision
Like a cripple running the rat race
Wish in one hand shoot in the other
And see which one gets filled first
I 'm on a roll
No self comtrol
I 'm blowing off steam with methamphetamine
Don't know what I want
That 's all that I 've got
And I 'm picking scabs off my face
Breakin ' rocks in the hot sun
I fought the law and the law won
I needed the money ' cause I had none
I fought the law and the law won
I miss my baby and I feel so sad
I guess my race is run
Well she 's the best girl that I ever had
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the
Robin ' people with a six gun
I fought the law and the law won
I miss my baby and I miss my fun
I fought the law and the law won
I miss my baby and I feel so sad
I guess my race is run
Well she 's the best girl that I ever had
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the
I fought the law and the law won [ x7 ]
I fought the law and the
I see has found its way to me ,
It 's old and it 's old and it 's old
Making me cry ,
I sleep but I will not move ,
Too scared to leave my room ,
But I won't be defeated , oh no ,
What if cars don't go my way ?
And it 's sure to spoil my day .
But in voices loud and clear ,
You say to me it 's only superstition ,
It 's only your imagination ,
It 's only all of the things that you fear ,
And the things from which you can't escape ,
Keep clean for the thousandth time ,
Stand still and wait in line ,
Some numbers are badder than others , oh no ,
What if cars don't go my way ?
And it 's sure to spoil my day .
But in voices loud and clear ,
You say to me it 's only superstition ,
It 's only your imagination ,
It 's only all of the things that you fear ,
And the things from which you cannot escape .
But it 's making me cry , and it 's making me cry ,
And I 'm slipping away and I 'm slipping away ,
It 's only superstition , only your imagination ,
It 's only superstition , only superstition .
Runners , until the race is run
Soldiers , you 've got to soldier on
Sometimes even right is wrong
They are turning my head out
To see what I 'm all about
Keeping my head down
To see what it feels like now
But I have no doubt
One day , we are gonna get out
Tonight maybe we 're gonna run
Dreaming of the Osaka sun
Ohh ohh .
Dreaming of when the morning comes
They are turning my head out
To see what I 'm all about
Keeping my head down
To see what it feels like now
But I have no doubt
One day the sun will come out
.
Reign of love
I can't let go
To the sea I offer
This heavy load
Locusts will
Lift me up
I 'm just a prisoner
In a reign of love
Locusts will
Let us stop
I wish I 'd spoken
To the reign of love
Reign of love
By the church , we 're waiting
Reign of love
My knees go praying
How I wish
I 'd spoken up
Or we 'd be carried
In the reign of love .
Come
Coming at you
Come
Coming at you
Come
Coming at you .
Yo , peep the style and the kids checking for it
The number one question is " how could you ignore it ? "
We drop right back in the cut
Over basement tracks
With raps that got you backing this up like
{ Like rewind that }
We 're just rollin ' with the rhythm ,
Rise from the ashes of stylistic division
With these non-stop lyrics are life living ,
Not to be forgotten , but still unforgiven
But in the meantime , there are those
Who wanna talk this and that , so I suppose
It gets to a point feelings got to get hurt ,
And get dirty with the people spreading the dirt
It goes .
Tried to give you warning , but everyone ignores me
Told you everything loud and clear
But nobody 's listening
Call to you so clearly , but you don't want to hear me
Told you everything loud and clear
But nobody 's listening
I got a heart full of pain , head full of stress
Hand full of anger , held in my chest
And everything left 's a waste of time ,
I hate my rhymes , but hate everyone else 's more
I 'm riding on the back of this pressure ,
Guessing that it 's better , I can't keep myself together
Because all of this stress gave me something to write on ,
But pain gave me something I could set my sights on
Never forget the blood , sweat and tears ,
The uphill struggle over years , the fear and
Trash talking and the people it was to ,
And the people that started it , just like you
Tried to give you warning , but everyone ignores me
Told you everything loud and clear
But nobody 's listening
Called to you so clearly , but you don't want to hear me
Told you everything loud and clear
But nobody 's listening
I got a heart full of pain , head full of stress
Hand full of anger , held in my chest
Uphill struggle , blood , sweat and tears
Nothing to gain , everything to fear
Heart full of pain , head full of stress
Hand full of anger , held in my chest
Uphill struggle , blood , sweat and tears
Nothing to gain , everything to fear
Heart full of pain
Heart full of pain .
Tried to give you warning , but everyone ignores me
Told you everything loud and clear
But nobody 's listening
Called to you so clearly , but you don't want to hear me
Told you everything loud and clear
But nobody 's listening
I got a heart full of pain , head full of stress
Nobody 's listening
Hand full of anger , held in my chest
Nobody 's listening
Uphill struggle , blood , sweat and tears
Nobody 's listening
Nothing to gain , everything to fear
Nobody 's listening
Come
Coming at you
Coming
Coming at you
Come
Coming
Come
Coming
Coming at you
Come
Coming at you from every side
her secret disguised behind the lies
and at night she crys away her pride
with eyes shut tight staring at her inside
all her friends know why she can't sleep at night
all her family asking is she alright
all she wants to do is get rid of this hell
well all she 's got to do is stop kiddin herself
she can only fool herself for so long [ x3 ]
are you too weak to face me
( she can only fool herself )
[ chorus ]
i never know just why you run so far away far away from me [ x2 ]
when it comes to how to live his life and can't be told
says he got everything under control
thinks he knows he 's not a problem he 's stuck with
but in reality it would be a problem to just quit
an addict and he can't hold the reigns
the pain is worse cause his friends have it the same
trys to slow down the problem he 's got
but can't get off the carousel untill he makes it stop
he can only fool himself for so long [ x3 ]
are you too weak to face me
( he can only fool himself )
[ chorus x2 ]
Try to fly with the wings I gave you ,
Try to do what you believe and I 'll save you [ x2 ]
[ chorus x2 ]
Drive a faster car
To take me anywhere in seconds
To take me anywhere I wanna go
And drive around a faster car
I will settle for nothing less
I wanna be bigger , stronger
Drive a faster car
At the touch of a button
I can go anywhere I wanna go
And drive around my faster car
I will settle for nothing less
I think I wanna change my attitude
I think I wanna change my ah , my atmosphere
I wanna be strong
I wanna be bigger , stronger
Drive a faster car
To take me anywhere in seconds
To take me anywhere I wanna go
And drive around my faster car
I will settle for nothing less
I think I need to change my attitude
I think I wanna change my attitude
I think I wanna change my ah , my atmosphere
I wanna be strong
Bigger and better
Bigger , stronger
Drive a faster car
At the touch of a button
I can go anywhere I wanna go
No one was looking , I was thinking of you
Oh yeah , did I mention I was all by myself
All by myself .
I went to your house , but no one was there
I went to your room
I was all by myself
You and me had
Such wonderful times
When I 'm all by myself ,
All by myself
[ repeat several times ]
Yo , yo
Forfeit the game
Before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame
Puts your name to shame
Cover up your face
You can't run the race
The pace is too fast
You just won't last
You love the way I look at you
While taking pleasure in the awful things you put me through
You take away if I give in
My life , my pride is broken
You like to think you 're never wrong ( You like to think you 're never wrong )
You have to act like you 're someone ( You have to act like you 're someone )
You want someone to hurt like you ( You want someone to hurt like you )
You want to share what you 've been through
You live what you 've learned
You love the things I say I 'll do
The way I 'll hurt myself again just to get back at you
You take away when I give in
My life , my pride is broken
You like to think you 're never wrong ( You like to think you 're never wrong )
You have to act like you 're someone ( You have to act like you 're someone )
You want someone to hurt like you ( You want someone to hurt like you )
You want to share what you 've been through
You live what you 've learned
Yo , yo
Forfeit the game
Before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame
Puts your name to shame
Cover up your face
You can't run the race
The pace is too fast
You just won't last
Forfeit the game
Before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame ( frame )
Puts your name to shame
Cover up your face
( You ) You can't run the race
The pace is too fast
You just won't last
You like to think you 're never wrong ( You like to think you 're never wrong )
You have to act like you 're someone ( You have to act like you 're someone )
You want someone to hurt like you ( You want someone to hurt like you )
You want to share what you 've been through
You like to think you 're never wrong ( You like to think you 're never wrong )
You have to act like you 're someone ( You have to act like you 're someone )
You want someone to hurt like you ( You want someone to hurt like you )
You want to share what you 've been through
You live what you 've learned
You said I 'm gonna buy this place and burn it down ,
I 'm gonna put it six feet underground ,
You said I 'm gonna buy this place and watch it fall ,
Stand here beside me baby in the crumbling walls ,
Oh I 'm gonna buy this place and start a fire ,
Stand here until I fill all your hearts desires ,
Because I 'm gonna buy this place and see it burn ,
And do back the things it did to you in return
You said I 'm gonna buy a gun and start a war ,
If you can tell me something worth fighting for ,
Oh and I 'm gonna buy this place is what I said ,
Blame it upon a rush of blood to the head
Honey , all the movements you 're starting to make ,
See me crumble and fall on my face ,
And I know the mistakes that I 've made ,
See it all disappear without a trace ,
And they call as they beckon you on ,
They say start as you need to go on ,
Start as you need to go on ,
Start as you need to go on
Said I 'm gonna buy this place and see it go ,
Stand here beside me baby , watch the orange glow ,
Some 'll laugh and some just sit and cry ,
You just sit down there and you wonder why ,
So I 'm gonna buy a gun and start a war ,
If you can tell me something worth fighting for ,
I 'm gonna buy this place is what I said ,
Blame it upon a rush of blood to the head ,
Oh to the head
Coz ' honey , all the movements you 're starting to make ,
See me crumble and fall on my face ,
And I know the mistakes that I 've made ,
See it all disappear without a trace ,
And they call as they beckon you on ,
They say start as you need to go on ,
As you need to go on
So meet me by the bridge ,
Meet me by the lane ,
When am I gonna see that pretty face again ,
Oh meet me on the road ,
Meet me where I said ,
Blame it all upon a rush of blood to the head
Sometimes
Hybrid
I 've been digging into crates
Ever since I was living in space
Before the ratrace
Before monkeys had human traits
I mastered numerology
And Big Bang theology
Performed lobotomies
With telekinetic psychology
Invented the mic
So I could start blessing it
Chin-checking kids to make my point like an impressionist
Many men have tried to shake us
But I twist mic cords in double-helixes
To show them what I 'm made of
I buckle knees like leg-braces
Cast a spell of instrumentalness on all of you emcees who hate us
So you can try on
Leave you without a shoulder to cry on
From now to infinity
Let icons be bygones
I fire bomb
Ghostly notes haunt this
I tried threats but moved onto a promise
I stomp s*t with or without an accomplice
And run the gauntlet with whoever that wants this
High voltage
This is the unforgettable sound
High voltage
Bringing you up and taking you down
High voltage
Coming at you from every side
High voltage
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide
Akira
I put a kink in the backbones of clones with microphones
Never satisfied my rhyme jones
Spraying bright day over what you might say
My type 's Krylon , Technicolour Type-A
On highways , right with road-rage
Cages of wind and cages of tin that bounce all around
Surround sound
Devouring the scene
Subliminal gangrene paintings
Overall the same things
Sing songs , karaoke , copy , bulls*t
Break bones verbally with sticks-and-stones tactics
Fourth dimension , combat convention
Write rhymes at ease while the track stands at attention
Meant to put you away
With the pencil , pistol , official , sixteen-line-a-rhyme missile
While you risk your all
I pick out all your flaws
Spin rah , blah , blah , blah
You can say you saw
High voltage
This is the unforgettable sound
High voltage
Bringing you up and taking you down
High voltage
Coming at you from every side
High voltage
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide
High voltage
This is the unforgettable sound
High voltage
Bringing you up and taking you down
High voltage
Coming at you from every side
High voltage
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide
Who 's the man demanding you hand over your Land Rover
No man 's bolder than the Pharoahe when he jams
The plan 's over
I have fake sclerosis
The most ferocious
Why I spy , my third eye , distinctly high voltage
That 's why I need Ruby Quartz glasses
' Cause when I glance there 's a chance I might blast the masses
Subliminals trasmitted through piano
Integrated in flow
Calculated to nano
I use skills when I need
Please head the rhyme I hear when I plead when I proceed through time
I walk through walls an inanimate obsticles
Via induced reduction of cells and molecules
I bring the knowledge
You swallow the state
That 's a hologram
I box your head
Fatten your lip like Collogen
A telepath to deliver verses with no postage
Pharoahe Monch , Mike Shinoda
We high voltage
High voltage
This is the unforgettable sound
High voltage
Bringing you up and taking you down
High voltage
Coming at you from every side

Bringing you up and taking you down

Linkin Park
Fighting with my weak hand
Driven to distraction
So part of the plan
When something is broken
And you try to fix it
Trying to repair it
Any way you can
I 'm diving off the deep end
You become my best friend
I wanna love you
But I don't know if I can
I know something is broken
And I 'm trying to fix it
Trying to repair it
Any way I can
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh .
You and me are floating on a tidal wave .
Together
You and me are drifting into outer space .
And singing
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh .
You and me are floating on a tidal wave .
Together
You and me are drifting into outer space
You and me are floating on a tidal wave .
Together
You and me are drifting into outer space .
And singing
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh .
Hey , yo
When this first started off
It was just Linkin Park
And then in the middle
Came Motion Man
And at the end of it all
It was Kutmasta Kurt
With a remix
One thing , I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme when I was obsessed with time
All I know , time was just slipping away
And I watched it count down to the end of the day
Watched it watch me and the words that I say
The echo of the clock rhythm in my veins
I know that I didn't look out below
And I watched the time go right out the window
Tried to grab hold
Tried not to watch
I wasted it all on the hands of the clock
But in the end , no matter what I pretend
The journey is more important than the end or the start
And what it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when I tried so hard
I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
Hey , yo
One thing , I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme to explain in due time
All I know , hah , I so-socialse
Like the host of the party
I spoke , shaked , and made eye-contact
Partied and toasted strong , all that
Northeast , Southwest coast
I 'm staring out the window
No oppourtunity to mingle
I tried to sew it up to weaken your system
I had you throwing up
I brought you back into things
Like the imaginary man of your dreams
You 'd always seem to make it worth it
I picked skin , I never nursed it
You felt like loving , never played real
I 'm bringing the pleasure
By any means it means I 'm leaving your team
Hell of a team , man it seems I tried so hard
I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
Linkin Park

Motion Man

Kutmasta Kurt
Linkin Park
Remix
Motion Man
Linkin Park
In the end
Kutmasta Kurt
Remix
One thing , I don't know how
It doesn't even matter when you look at it now
' Cause when I designed this rhyme
I was scared of it all , scared to fall , and I hadn't even tried to crawl
But I was forced to run with you mocking me , stopping me , backstabbing me constantly
Remembering all the times you fought with me
Watch the clock now chock-full of hipocrisy
But now your mouth wishes it could inhale
Every single little thing you said to make things fail
Every single word you sputtered just to get your piece
But it really doesn't matter to me
' Cause from the start to the end , no matter what I pretend
The journey is more important than the end or the start
And what it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when I tried so hard
I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
In the end
I wanna live life , be good to you .
I wanna fly , never come down ,
And live my life ,
And have friends around .
We never change , do we
We never learned to leave ,
So I wanna live in a wooden house ,
I wanna live life , always be true ,
I wanna live life , and be good to you ,
I wanna fly , and never come down ,
And I live my life , and have friends around .
We never change do we No , no ,
We never learned to bleed ,
So I wanna live in a wooden house ,
Making more friends would be easy .
O I don't have a show to say ,
Yes , and I sing of a single day ,
We never change do we
We never learned to leave .
So , I wanna live life in a wooden house ,
Making more friends would be easy ,
I wanna live where the sun comes out
So turn me around and face the wall .
Read me my rights and tell me I 'm wrong .
Until it gets into my thick skull .
A slap on the wrist .
A stab in the back .
Torture me , I 've been a bad boy .
Nail me to the cross until you have won .
I lost before I did any wrong .
I 'm hexed with regrets and bad luck .
Keep you distance ' cause it 's rubbing off .
Or you will be darned to spend your life in heck .
Or earth with me tangled at your feet .
You finally met you nemesis disguised as your fatal long lost love .
So kiss it good bye
Until death do we part .
You fell for a jinx for crying out loud .
You 're wasting your talent , Randy
It 's like I 'm paranoid lookin ' over my back
It 's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It 's like I can't stop what I 'm hearing within
It 's like the face inside is right
Why does it feel like night today ?
Something in here 's not right today .
Why am I so uptight today ?
Paranoia 's all I got left
I don't know what stressed me first
Or how the pressure was fed
But I know just what it feels like
To have a voice in the back of my head
Like a face that I hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face watches every time I lie
A face that laughs every time I fall
And watches everything
So I know that when it 's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is hearing me
Right beneath my skin
It 's like I 'm paranoid lookin ' over my back
It 's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It 's like I can't stop what I 'm hearing within
It 's like the face inside is right
You know I - thug em , fuck em , love em , leave em
Cause I don't fuckin need em
Take em out the hood , keep em lookin good
But I don't fuckin feed em
First time they fuss I 'm breezin
Talkin bout , " What 's the reasons ? "
I 'm a pimp in every sense of the word , bitch
Better trust than believe em
In the cut where I keep em
til I need a nut , til I need to beat the guts
Then it 's , beep beep and I 'm pickin em up
Let em play with the dick in the truck
Many chicks wanna put Jigga fist in cuffs
Divorce him and split his bucks
Just because you got good head , I'ma break bread
so you can be livin it up ? Shit I .
parts with nothin , y'all be frontin
Me give my heart to a woman ?
Not for nothin , never happen
I 'll be forever mackin
Heart cold as assassins , I got no passion
I got no patience
And I hate waitin .
Hoe get yo ' ass in

H to the izz-O , V to the izz-A

Was herbin ' em in the home of the Terrapins
Got it dirt cheap for them
Plus if they was short wit ' cheese I would work wit ' them
Boy and we . got rid of that dirt for them
Wasn't born hustlers I was burpin ' em
H to the izz-O , V to the izz-A
Fo ' sheezy my neezy keep my arms so breezy
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
Haters want me clapped and chromed it ain't easy
Cops wanna knock me , D.A. wanna box me in
But somehow , I beat them charges like Rocky
H to the izz-O , V to the izz-A
Not guilty , he who does not feel me is not real to me
Therefore he doesn't exist
So poof . vamoose son of a bitch
H to the izz-O , V to the izz-A
Fo ' shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in VA
H to the izz-O , V to the izz-A
That 's the anthem get'cha damn hands up
H to the izz-O , V to the izz-A
Not guilty ya 'll go t-t a feel me
H to the izz-O , V to the izz-A
Yo , It starts with
One thing , I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind , I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away
It 's so unreal
I Didn't look out below
I Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on , and didn't even know
Wasted it all just to
Watch you go
I kept everything inside and even though I tried , it all fell apart
What it meant to me , will eventually , be a memory , of a time when I tried so
H to the izz-O , V to the izz-A
LP , Jay-Z , help me out
Oh , they havin ' a good o ' time out there
It starts with
H to the izz-O , V to the izz-A
LP , Jay-Z , help me out
Oh , they havin ' a good o ' time out there
It starts with
H to the izz-O , V to the izz-A
LP , Jay-Z , help me out
Ladies and Gentalmen
It starts with
Of our lives
Tomorrow is too late to pretend
Everything 's allright
I 'm not getting any younger as long
As you don't get any older
I 'm not going to state that yesterday never was
Bloodshot deadbeat and a lack of sleep
Making your mascara bleed
Tears down your face
Leaving traces of my mistakes
If I promise to go to church on Sunday
Will you go with ne on Friday night
If you live with me , I 'll die for you
And this compromise
I hereby solenly to tell
The whole truth
And nothing but the truth is what
I 'll ever hear from you
" Trust " is a dirty word that comes
Only from such a liar
But " respect " is something I will earn .
If you have faith
The only one that I have ever known
Don't know where it goes
But it 's home to me and I walk alone
I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps
and I 'm the only one and I walk alone
I walk alone
I walk a .
My shadow 's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart 's the only thing that 's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
' Til then I walk alone
Ah-ah , Ah-ah , Ah-ah , Aaah-ah ,
Ah-ah , Ah-ah , Ah-ah
I 'm walking down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the border line
Of the edge and where I walk alone
Read between the lines
What 's fucked up and everything 's alright
Check my vital signs
To know I 'm still alive and I walk alone
I walk alone
I walk a .
My shadow 's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart 's the only thing that 's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
' Til then I walk alone
Ah-ah , Ah-ah , Ah-ah , Aaah-ah
Ah-ah , Ah-ah
I walk alone
I walk a .
I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I 'm the only one and I walk a .
My shadow 's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart 's the only thing that 's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
' Til then I walk alone .
And nowhere is my home
Where dignity 's a land mine
In the school of lost hope
I 've panhandled for a life because
I 'm not afraid to beg
Hand me down your lost and founds
Of second hand regret
You better swallow your pride
Or you 're gonna choke on it
You better digest your values
Because they turn to shoot
Honor 's gonna knock you down
Before your chance to stand up and fight
I know I 'm not the one
I got no pride
Sects of disconnection
And traditions of lost faith
No culture 's worth a stream of piss
Or a bullet in my face
To heck with unity
Seperation 's gonna kill us all
Torn to shreds and disjointed
Before the final fall
You better swallow your pride
Or you 're gonna choke on it
You better digest your values
Because they turn to shoot
Honor 's gonna knock you down
Before your chance to stand up and fight
I know I 'm not the one
I got no pride
You better swallow your pride
Or you 're gonna choke on it
You better digest your values
Because they turn to shoot
Honor 's gonna knock you down
Before your chance to stand up and fight
I know I 'm not the one
I got no pride .
Close your eyes and die .
I got no pride .
Made , made my way through the front door .
Broke my engagement with myself .
Perfect picture of bad health , another notch scratched on my belt .
The future just ain't what it used to be .
I got a new start on a dead end road .
Peaked , peaked out on reaching new lows .
Owe , I paid off all my debts to myself .
Perfect picture of bad health , another notch scratched on my belt .
The future 's in my living room .
Uptight , I 'm a nag with a gun .
All night , suicide 's last call .
I 've been uptight all night .
I 'm a son of a gun .
Uptight I 'm a nag with a gun .
There is a house in New Orleans , They call the Rising Sun
It 's been the ruin of many a poor boy , and God , I know I 'm one .
I cried to my daddy on the telephone ,
how long now ?
Until the clouds unroll and you come down ,
the line went .
But the shadows still remain since your descent ,
your descent .
I cried to my daddy on the telephone ,
how long now ?
Until the clouds unroll and you come home ,
the line went .
But the shadows still remain since your descent ,
your descent .
The saints are coming , the saints are coming .
I say no matter how I try , I realise there 's no reply .
The saints are coming , the saints are coming .
I say no matter how I try , I realise there 's no reply .
A drowning sorrow floods the deepest grief ,
how long now ?
Until the weather change condemns belief ,
how long now ?
When the night watchman lets in the thief
Whats wrong now ?
The saints are coming , the saints are coming
I say no matter how I try , I realise there 's no reply .
The saints are coming , the saints are coming
I say no matter how I try , I realise there 's no reply .
I say no matter how I try , I realise there 's no reply .
Everyone left you .
They 're all out without you .
Having fun .
Where have all the bastards gone ?
The underbelly stacks up ten high
The dummy failed the crash test
Collecting unemployment checks
Like a flunkie along for the ride
Where have all the riots gone
As the city 's motto gets pulverized ?
What 's in love is now in debt
On your birth certificate
So strike the fucking match to light this fuse !
The town bishop is an extortionist
And he don't even know that you exist
Standing still when it 's do or die
You better run for your fucking life
It 's not over ' till you 're underground
It 's not over before it 's too late
This city 's burnin '
It 's not my burden
It 's not over before it 's too late
There 's nothing left to analyze
Where will all the martyrs go when the virus cures itself ?
And where will we all go when it 's too late ?
And don't look back
You 're not the Jesus of Suburbia
The St. Jimmy is a figment of
Your father 's rage and your mother 's love
Made me the idiot America
It 's not over ' till you 're underground
It 's not over before it 's too late
This city 's burnin '
It 's not my burden
It 's not over before it 's too late
She said I can't take this place
I 'm leaving it behind
Well she said I can't take this town
I 'm leaving you tonight
Time to chill in the bar again
Never seize to amaze in minds
So I just sleep sleep sleep please don't
Wake me till the morning after [ 2x ]
Cut my peace () by the flower again
Lick my wounds like a dove again
Is that a light at the end of the tunnel
That I see I see please let it be but don't
Wake me till the morning after [ 3x ]
Oh I 'm so tired there has got to be an end
to the pain I feel when I 'm
awake and alive alive alive
alive and not dreamin '
Caught up against the war again
Time to chill in the bar again
Is that a light at the end of the tunnel
That I see I see please let it be but don't
Wake me till the morning after [ 3x ]
Oh I 'm so tired there has got to be an end
to the pain I feel when I 'm
Awake and alive alive alive
Alive and not dreamin '
It 's the time of your lives
Break down , break down
Gotta spread love around
Gotta spread it around
Brothers and sisters feel fine
It 's the time of your lives
No sound , no sound
Like this feeling you 've found
But just stay down
' Cos some sounds you 'll feel
So stay down
And some sounds you 'll feel
And it 's me they 're looking for
And it 's me
I will never survive
But we 'll be around some more
Brothers and sisters unite
It 's the time of your lives
Break down , break down
Gotta spread love around
Gotta spread it around
But just stay down
And some sounds you 'll feel
So stay ' round
And some sounds you 'll feel
And it 's me they 're looking for
And it 's me
I will never survive
But we 'll be around some more
it 's gonna be alright ( x 3 )

Haha , call me back , peace
Bitter sweet migraine in my head
Its like a throbbing tooth ache of the mind

Drain the pressure from the swelling ,
The sensations overwhelming ,
Give me a long kiss goodnight

Tell me that I won't feel a thing

Out of body and out of mind
Kiss the demons out of my dreams

Help is just around the corner , for us ,
And help is just around the corner , for us ,
Oh that help is just around the corner , for us
I 'm counting sheep but running out
As time ticks by
And still I try
No rest for crosstops in my mind
On my own . here we go
My eyes feel like they 're gonna bleed
Dried up and bulging out my skull
My mouth is dry
My face is numb
freaked up and spun out in my room
On my own . here we go
My mind is set on overdrive
The clock is laughing in my face
A crooked spine
My sense dulled
Passed the point of delerium
On my own . here we go
My eyes feel like they 're gonna bleed
Dried up and bulging out my skull
My mouth is dry
My face is numb
freaked up and spun out in my room
On my own . here we go
Too much just ain't enough to keep her satisfied
Her plastic card is filled with nothing comes to mind
It 's now her occupation that she 's overqualified
The looks are always so deceiving
The truth is always misconstrued
To you .
Too much too soon
Too little and now your coming unglued
Too much too soon
Too late and now it sucks to be you
Too much too soon
Too little and now your coming unglued
Too much too soon
Too late and now it sucks to be you too
He 's talking shit about how it 's better way back when
He lives every waking moment as means to an end
We are we are but I 'm not
I never used to be
So god bless your fucking past and to hell with your glory
The looks are always so deceiving
The truth is always misconstrued
Too much too soon
Too little and now your coming unglued
Too much too soon
Too late and now it sucks to be you
Too much too soon
Too little and now your coming unglued
Too much too soon
Too late and now it sucks to be you too
She packs her bags and says goodbye and bon voyage
Farewell we 'll see you in hell I hope you rest in pieces
Fuck you
Oh . oh oh oh oh .
Too much too soon
Too little and now your coming unglued
Too much too soon
Too late and now it sucks to be you
Too much too soon
Too little and now your coming unglued
Too much too soon
Too late and now it sucks to be you too
Woah . oh oh oh oh .
Under a sky of dust
A constant wave of tension
On top of broken trust
The lessons that you taught me
I learn were never true
Now I find myself in question
( They point the finger at me again )
Guilty by association
( You point the finger at me again )
I wanna run away
Never say goodbye
I wanna know the truth
Instead of wondering why
I wanna know the answers
No more lies
I wanna shut the door
And open up my mind
Paper bags and angry voices
Under a sky of dust
Another wave of tension
Has more than filled me up
All my talk of taking action
These words were never true
Now I find myself in question
( They point the finger at me again )
Guilty by association
( You point the finger at me again )
I wanna run away
Never say goodbye
I wanna know the truth
Instead of wondering why
I wanna know the answers
No more lies
I wanna shut the door
And open up my mind
i 'm gonna run away and never say goodbye
( gonna run away gonna run away gonna run away gonna run away )
i 'm gonna run away and never wonder why
( gonna run away gonna run away gonna run away gonna run away )
i 'm gonna run away and open my mind
( gonna run away gonna run away gonna run away gonna run away gonna run away gonna run away gonna run away gonna run away )
I wanna run away
Never say goodbye
I wanna know the truth
Instead of wondering why
I wanna know the answers
No more lies
I wanna shut the door
And open up my mind
i wanna run away
and open up my mind
i wanna run away
and open up my mind
i wanna run away
and open up my mind
i wanna run away
and open up my mind
Staring at the walls
I 've been up all damn night long
My pulse is speeding
My love is yearning
I hold my breath and close my eyes and .
Dream about her
Cause she 's 2000 light years away
She holds my malakite so tight so .
Never let go
Cause she 's 2000 light years away
Years Away !
I sit outside and watch the sunrise
Lookout as far as I can
I can't see her , but in the distance
I hear some laughter ,
We laugh together
I hold my breath and close my eyes and .
Dream about her
Cause she 's 2000 light years away
She holds my malakite so tight so .
Never let go
Cause she 's 2000 light years away
Years Away !
I sit alone in my bedroom
Staring at the walls
I 've been up all damn night long
My pulse is speeding
My love is yearning
I hold my breath and close my eyes and .
Dream about her
Cause she 's 2000 light years away
She holds my malakite so tight so .
Never let go
Cause she 's 2000 light years away
My heart is beating from me
I am standing all alone
Please call me only if you are coming home
Waste another year flies by
Waste a night or two
You taught me how to live
In the streets of shame
Where you 've lost your dreams in the rain
There 's no signs of hope
The stems and seeds of the last of the dope
There 's a glow of light
The St. Jimmy is the spark in the night
Bearing gifts and trust
The fixture in the city of lust
What the hell 's your name ?
What 's your pleasure and whats your pain ?
Do you dream to much ?
Do you think what you need is a crutch ?
In the crowd of pain . St. Jimmy comes without any shame
He says we 're fucked up
But we 're not the same
And mom and dad are the ones you can blame
Jimmy died today
He blew his brains out into the bay
In the state of mind it 's my own private suicide
[ Part 2 : East 12th St. ]
Well nobody cares
Does anyone care if nobody cares ?
[ x2 ]
Jesus filling out paperwork now
At the facility on east 12th st.
He 's not listened to a word now
He 's in his own world
And he 's daydreaming
He 'd rather be doing something else now ,
Like cigarettes and coffee with the underbelly ,
His life 's on the line with anxiety now ,
And she had enough ,
And he had plenty
Somebody get me out of here
Anybody get me out of here
Somebody get me out of here
Get me the fuck right out of here
So far away
I don't want to stay
Get me out of here right now
I just wanna be free
Is there a possibility ?
Get me out of here right now
This life like dream ain't for me
[ Part 3 : Nobody likes you ! ]
I fell asleep while watching spike TV
After 10 cups of coffee
And you 're still not here
Dreaming of a song
But something went wrong
But I can't tell anyone
' Cause no one 's here
Left me here alone
And I should have stayed home
After 10 cups of coffee I 'm thinking
( where 'd you go ? )
Nobody likes you , everyone left you
( where 'd you go ? )
They 're all out without you havin ' fun
( where 'd you go ? )
Everyone left you , nobody likes you
( where 'd you go ? )
They 're all out without you havin ' fun
( where 'd you go . go . go . go . )
Geeze . Ha .
[ Part 4 : Rock and roll girlfriend ]
[ written and sung by Tre Cool ]
I got a rock and roll band
I got a rock and roll life
I got a rock and roll girlfriend
And another ex-wife
I got a rock and roll house
I got a rock and roll car
I play the shit out the drums
And I can play the guitar
I got a kid in New York
I got a kid in the bay
I haven't drank or smoked nothin '
In over 22 days
So get off my case
Off of my case
Off of my case !
[ Part 5 : We 're coming home again ]
Here they come marching down the street
Like a desperation murmur of a heart beat
Coming back from the edge of town
Underneath their feet
The time has come and it going nowhere
Nobody ever said that life was fair now
Go-carts and guns are treasures they will bear
In the summer heat
The world is spinning
Around and around
Out of control again
From the 7-11 to the fear of breaking down
To send my love a letterbomb
And visit me in hell
We 're the ones going
Home
We 're coming home again
Home
We 're coming home again
I started fuckin ' running
As soon as my feet touched the ground
We 're back in the Barrio
But to you and me , that 's jingle town
Home
We 're coming home again
Home
We 're coming home again
Home
We 're coming home again
Home
We 're coming home again
Home
We 're coming home again
Home
We 're coming home again
Home
We 're coming home again
Home
We 're coming home again
Home
We 're coming home again
Nobody likes you
Everyone left you
They 're all out without you havin ' fun

You don't know how lovely you are
I had to find you , tell you I need ya
And tell you I set you apart
Tell me your secrets , and nurse me your questions
Oh lets go back to the start
Running in circles , coming in tails
Heads on a science apart
Nobody said it was easy
It 's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard
Oh take me back to the start
I was just guessing at numbers and figures
Pulling the puzzles apart
Questions of science , science and progress
Do not speak as loud as my heart
And tell me you love me , come back and haunt me
Oh and I rush to the start
Running in circles , chasing tails
Coming back as we are
Nobody said it was easy
Oh it 's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be so hard
I 'm going back to the start
Ooooohhhhhhh [ x4 ]
I wonder if he knows I think he 's crazy
When he was young did he have dreams
Of wearing woman 's shoes and being crazy
It makes me wonder when I grow to be that age
Will I be walking down the street begging for your spare change
Or will I grow that old
Will I still be around
The way I carry on I 'll end up
Six feet underground
And waste away .
When the old man was in school
Did the golden rule make him go crazy
Or did he hide away from hopes
Behind a smile and smoking dope
It 's crazy
It makes me wonder when I grow to be that age
Will I be walking down the street begging for your spare change
Or will I grow that old
Will I still be around
The way I carry on I 'll end up
Six feet underground
And waste away .
It seems so frightening
Time passes by like lightning
Before you know it you 're struck down
I always waste my time on my chemical emotions
It keeps my head spinning around
And waste away .
It seems so frightening
Time passes by like lightning
Before you know it you 're struck down
I always waste my time on my chemical emotions
It keeps my head spinning around
And waste away .
And when this X is still stuck in my head
But misled doing the things I do would make you never wanna come back
But an all front attack , so you could never run from that
Being trapped in this beau , some that I never wanted to do
But through it all you 've got to see that what I want to be
Is over the pen again letting it out of me
In the center of the day in the dream , seeing all my thoughts
Getting lost in between , realizing one that the way to the sea
And the killing and again are in the head with the screams
I wanna live in another place
Where no one can say that I live for them
( You 'll see its not meant to be from me )
I wanna be in the energy , not with the enemy
A place for my head
We 're gonna be crushed when it all falls apart
Going in the hollow , hoping that you won't know
The strain it puts to me , seeing what you 've done
And consequently I 've run away , just hitting again
Within the boundaries of an anguish
Want me to say this , but you 're dragging me down
Lost in the chaos being tossed around
Singing again to myself , a head full of hectic
Hope that some day you 'll regret this
Everything 's the wrong place , the wrong time
Adding to the panic in my confine
Singing again to myself , a head full of hectic
Hope that some day you 'll regret this
Everything 's the wrong place , the wrong time
Adding to the head again in my confine
I wanna live in another place
Where no one can say that I live for them
( You 'll see its not meant to be from me )
I wanna be in the energy , not with the enemy
A place for my head
You
Try to take the best of me
Go away
You
Try to take the best of me
Go away
You
Try to take the best of me
Go away
You
Try to take the best of me
GO AWAY
You
Try to take the best of me , go away
You
Try to take the best of me , go away
You
Try to take the best of me , go away
You
Try to take the best of me , go AWAY
I wanna live in another place
Where no one can say that I live for them
( You 'll see its not meant to be from me )
I wanna be in the energy , not with the enemy
A place for my head
Shut up ( next words are mumbled , might be shut up again )
Singing again to myself , a head full of hectic
Hope that some day you 'll regret this
Everything 's the wrong place , the wrong time
Adding to the head again in my confine
Singing again to myself , a head full of hectic
Hope that some day you 'll regret this
Everything 's the wrong place , the wrong time
Adding to the head in my confine
The moon is shining bright
You are the one I need
Up at your window
I see a shadow
Silhouette of your grace
Here 's this flower
I picked for all the hours
That you 've spent with me
The one I love
That I 've been dreaming of
Sailing across the sea
Let my hands flow through
Your hair . Moving closer
A kiss we 'll share
Passionate love to be all night long
We 'll never break , as one too strong
Nothing 's more
Than what our love is for
As I kiss your cheek
Oh so softly
Hands flowing down my back
1,000 hours , I 'll never leave
Our romance
Is a love trance
And now we 'll never part
1,000 hours
Of such a love shower
We 'll never stop , once we start
Let my hands flow through
Your hair . Moving closer
A kiss we 'll share
Passionate love to be all night long
We 'll never break , as one too strong
Let my hands flow through
Your hair . Moving closer
A kiss we 'll share
Passionate love to be all night long
We 'll never break , as one too strong
Strrrooooonnnggg .
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own
I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy 's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
" Now the old king is dead ! Long live the king ! "
One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror , my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world
It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I 'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king ?
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror , my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror , my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world
Do I follow my fate to escape blindly ?
Do I hide my pride from these bad dreams
And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening ?
Do I let it go and try to stand it ?
Or do I try to catch them red-handed ?
Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness
Or do I trust nobody and live in loneliness ?
The sunlight burns the skin of sleeping men
I make the right turns but I 'm lost within
I put on my daily facade but then
I just end up getting hurt again
By myself
MYSELF ! I ask why
but in my mind I find
I can't rely on myself
MYSELF ! I ask why
but in my mind I find
I cant rely on myself
I can't hold on
To what I want when I 'm stretched so thin
It 's all too much to take in
I can't hold on
To anything watching everything spin
With thoughts of failure sinking in
If turn my back I 'm defenseless
And to give into fate seems senseless
If I hide my pride and let it all go on then they 'll
Take from me till everything is gone
If I let them go I 'll be outdone
But if I try to catch them I 'll be outrun
If I 'm killed by the questions like a cancer
Then I 'll be buried in the silence of the answer
By Myself
MYSELF ! I ask why
but in my mind I find
I can't rely on myself
MYSELF ! I ask why
but in my mind I find
I cant rely on myself
I can't hold on
To what I want when I 'm stretched so thin
It 's all too much to take in
I can't hold on
To anything watching everything spin
With thoughts of failure sinking in
How do you think
I 've lost so much
I 'm always afraid
That I 'm out of touch
How do you expect
I will know what to do
When all I know
Is what you tell me to
Don't you
KNOW
I can't tell you how to make it
GO
No matter what I do how hard I
TRY
I can't seem to convince myself
WHY
I 'm stuck on the outside
Don't you
KNOW
I can't tell you how to make it
GO
No matter what I do how hard I
TRY
I can't seem to convince myself
WHY
I 'm stuck on the outside
I can't hold on
To what I want when I 'm stretched so thin
It 's all too much to take in
I can't hold on
To anything watching everything spin
With thoughts of failure sinking in
I can't hold on
To what I want when I 'm stretched so thin
It 's all too much to take in
I can't hold on
To anything watching everything spin
With thoughts of failure from with .
I 'm gonna put it six feet underground
I 'm gonna buy this place and watch it fall
Stand here beside me baby in the crumbling walls
Oh I 'm gonna buy this place and start a fire
Stand here until I fill all your hearts desire
Because I 'm gonna buy this place and see it burn
And do back the things it did to you in return
Huuuhhhh [ x4 ]
You said I 'm gonna buy a gun and start a war
If you can tell me something worth fighting for
Oh and I 'm gonna buy this place is what I said
Blame it upon a rush of blood to the head
Honey , all the movements you 're starting to make
See me crumble and fall on my face
And I know the mistakes that I 've made
See it all disappear without a trace
And they call as they beckon you on
They say start as you need to go on
Start as you need to go on
Said I 'm gonna buy this place and see it go
Stand here beside me baby , watch the orange glow
Some 'll laugh and some just sit and cry
You just sit down there and you wonder why
So I 'm gonna buy a gun and start a war
If you can tell me something worth fighting for
I 'm gonna buy this place is what I said
Blame it upon a rush of blood to the head
Oh to the head
Honey , all the movements you 're starting to make
See me crumble and fall on my face
And I know the mistakes that I 've made
See it all disappear without a trace
And they call as they beckon you on
They say start as you need to go on
As you need to go on
So meet me by the bridge
Meet me by the lane
When am I gonna see that pretty face again
Oh meet me on the road
Meet me where I said
Blame it all upon a rush of blood to the head
Tired of waiting for you
I was a lonely soul
I had nobody till I met you
But you keep me waiting all of the time
What can I do ?
It 's your life
And you can do what you want
Do what you like
But please don't keep me waiting
Please don't keep me waiting
Cause i 'm so tired
Tired of waiting
Tired of waiting for you
My temper flies and I get myself all wound up
My fuse is short and my blood pressure is high
I lose control and I get myself all wound up
Tension mounts and I fly off the wall
I self destruct and I get myself all wound up
Petulance and irritation sets in
I throw a tantrum and I get myself all wound up
I lose myself and I 'm all wound up
Petulance and I 'm all wound up
I lose control and I 'm all wound up
I lose myself and I 'm all wound up
Chip on my shoulder and a leech on my back
Stuck in a rut and I get myself all wound up
Killed my composure and it will never come back
Loss of control and I get myelf all wound up
Blown out of proportion again
My temper snaps and I get myself all wound up
Spontaneous combustion panic attack
I slipped a gear and I get myself all wound up
I lose myself and I 'm all wound up
Petulance and I 'm all wound up
I lose control and I 'm all wound up
I lose myself and I 'm all wound up
I 've got a knack for freaking everything up
My temper flies and I get myself all wound up
My fuse is short and my blood pressure is high
I lose control and I get myself all wound up
Tension mounts and I fly off the wall
I self destruct and I get myself all wound up
Petulance and irritation sets in
I throw a tantrum and I get myself all wound up
I lose myself and I 'm all wound up
Petulance and I 'm all wound up
I lose control and I 'm all wound up
I lose myself and I 'm all wound up
Everyday reminded how much I hate it
Weighted against the consequences
Can't live without it so it 's senseless
Wanna cut it out of my soul
And just live with a gaping hole
Take control of my life
And wash out all the burnt taste
I made the problems in the first place
Hang my head low ' cause it 's part of me
Ya hardly see right next to the heart of me
Heard of me the routine scar
New cuts cover where the old ones are
And now I 'm sick of this
I can't stand the sandpaper thoughts that grade away on my sanity
I rather not even be then the man that 's staring in the mirror through me
Pre chorus
Cut myself free willingly
Sstop just what 's killing me [ 4x ]
I feel it everyday
I feel I made my way
I feel it swell up inside , swell up inside
Swallowing me
It can't be frightening if you 've never felt it
Once it 's been dealt with you feel like you 've been touched by something angelic
And then melted down into a pool of peace
Cease to be the animal you used to be
Remove the broken parts you know were wrong
And feel the karma when the problem 's all gone
And then you start to see another piece of yourself that you can't let be
And that reason 'll last fight to free yourself
Take it to the depths of the bottom of the well
And now you know you can choose to lose the part in your heart
Where your insides bruise
You can live if you 're willing to
Put a stop to just what 's killing you
[ Pre chorus ( 4x )]
[ Chorus ]
( Alive in me , inside of me , a part of me screams away silently
This part of me won't go away , part of me won't go away
Everywhere I look around I see how everyone aught to be
Every time I see myself I see there 's always something wrong with me )
[ Chorus ( 2x )]
I feel it swell up inside , swell up inside , swallowing me [ 2x ]
One thing / I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind / I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away
It 's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on / but didn't even know
Wasted it all just to
Watch you go
I kept everything inside and even though I tried / it all fell apart
What it meant to me / will eventually / be a memory / of a time when I tried
so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
One thing / I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind / I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I 'm surprised it got so ( far )
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me
In the end
You kept everything inside and even though I tried / it all fell apart
What it meant to me / will eventually / be a memory / of a time when I
I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I 've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
And for all this
There 's only one thing you should know
I 've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
And for all this
There 's only one thing you should know
I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
The white mist hits the ground
My lungs comfort me with joy
Vegging on one detail
The rest just crowds around
My eyes itch of burning red
Picture sounds
Of moving insects so surreal
Lay around
Looks like I found something new
Laying in my bed
I think I 'm in left field
I picture someone , I think it 's you
You 're standing so darn close
My body begins to swell
Why does 1 + 1 make 2
Picture sounds
Of moving insects so surreal
Lay around
Looks like I found something new
Laying in my bed
I think I 'm in left field
I picture someone , I think it 's you
You 're standing so darn close
My body begins to swell
Why does 1 + 1 make 2
Picture sounds
Of moving insects so surreal
Lay around
sick of me
You 're fed up with all my bad habits , you 're
sick of me
To your lies you 've become so desensitized
sick of me
Lost regrets and you say that your mad at me
sick of me
Wonderin ' out the door
I am on to you
Your comin ' back for more
Am I losing you
Like a dog that just pissed on your barbecue
sick of me
Losin ' faith and you still don't know what to do
sick of me
Losin ' health and now you hate everything and you 're
sick of me
It 's a waste but we still keep on tryin ' you 're
sick of me
Wonderin ' out the door
I am on to you
Your comin ' back for more
Am I losing you
So you got your problems
So you got it alright
Do you have a conscience
Do you have a reason
Well I 'm sick of you too .
Wonderin ' out the door
I am on to you
Your comin ' back for more
Am I losing you
Follow me to the other side
As I sit around and watch you pout
Cause I know that you 're the
Best thing in town - Best thing around
Running wild and always running free
Doing things that I have never seen
Eerie colors and all I see are sounds
Now I know that you 're the
Best thing in town - Best thing around
I 'm seeing faces .
Of mysterys of the earth
I am not one .
To the aggersions of my birth
Or go to stance .
Of houllinations I can't find
A missing peice .
Of a thought thats in my mind
Come with me and let 's go for a ride
Follow me to the other side
As I sit around and watch you pout
Cause I know that you 're the
Best thing in town - Best thing around
Running wild and always running free
Doing things that I have never seen
Eerie colors and all I see are sounds
Now I know that you 're the
Best thing in town - Best thing around
Sick and tired of all this wild shoot !
I know what you 'll say ,
You say , " Oh , sing one we know , "
But I promise you this ,
I 'll always look out for you ,
That 's what I 'll do .
I say " oh , "
I say " oh . "
My heart is yours ,
It 's you that I hold on to ,
That 's what I do ,
And I know I was wrong ,
But I won't let you down ,
( Oh yeah , oh yeah , oh yeah , yeah I will , yes I will :)
I say " oh , "
I cry " oh . "
Yeah I saw sparks ,
And I saw sparks ,
Yeah I saw sparks ,
Sing it out .
La , la , la , la , oh :
No colour or light
You think you 'll never get it right
But you 're wrong . You might .
The sky could fall , could fall on me
The parting of the sea
But you mean more , mean more to me
Than any colour I can see
All you ever wanted was love ,
But you never looked hard enough ,
It 's never gonna give itself up
All you ever wanted to be
Living in perfect symmetry ,
Nothing is as down or as up as us
You see the world in black and white
Not painted right
You see no meaning to your life
You should try
All you ever wanted was love ,
But you never looked hard enough ,
It 's never gonna give itself up
All you ever wanted to be ,
Living in perfect symmetry ,
Nothing is as down or as up
Don't you want to see it come soon ,
Floating in a big white balloon
Come give her your own silver spoon
Don't you want to see it come down ?
There for throwing your arms around
And say " You 're not a moment too soon . "
Cause I feel loved , cause I feel loved
ooooh .
Yeah I feel loved
oh n o.o ooh
Cause I feel loved , cause I feel loved
oh .
Yet I feel loved
oh n o.o ooh
And blew away as I collapsed , so cold
A black wind took them away , from sight
And held the darkness over day , that night
And the clouds above move closer
Looking so dissatisfied
But the heartless wind kept blowing , blowing
I used to be my own protection , but not now
Cause my path had lost direction , somehow
A black wind took you away , from sight
And held the darkness over day , that night
And the clouds above move closer
Looking so dissatisfied
And the ground below grew colder
As they put you down inside
But the heartless wind kept blowing , blowing
So now you 're gone , and I was wrong
I never knew what it was like , to be alone
On a Valentine 's Day , on a Valentine 's Day
( I used to be my own protection , but not now )
On a Valentine 's Day , on a Valentine 's Day
( Cause my mind has lost direction , somehow )
On a Valentine 's Day , on a Valentine 's Day
( I used to be my own protection , but not now )
On a Valentine 's Day , on a Valentine 's Day
( Cause my mind has lost direction , somehow )
I 've gotta say I 'm on my way down
God give me style and give me grace
God put a smile upon my face
Where do we go to draw the line
I 've gotta say I wasted all your time , ( oh honey honey )
Where do I go to fall from grace
God put a smile upon your face , yeah
Now , when you work it out I 'm worse than you
Yeah , when you work it out I wanted to
Now , when you work out where to draw the line
Your guess is as good as mine
Where do we go nobody knows
Don't even say you 're on your way down , ( when )
God gave you style and gave you grace
And put a smile upon your face , ah yeah
Now , when you work it out I 'm worse than you
Yeah , when you work it out I wanted to
Now , when you work out where to draw the line
Your guess is as good as mine
Its as good as mine [ x7 ]
Where do we go nobody knows
Don't even say you 're on your way down , ( when )
God gave you style and gave you grace
And put a smile upon your face
Yo , what up
It 's Stef , call me up
I 'm going to be in town all this week ;
So , if you want to get that track taken care of , let me know
Call me on my cell , all right
Later
So tired , tired of waiting , tired of waiting for you .
I was a lonely soul , I had nobody ' till I met you .
But you , keeping me waiting , all of the time
What can I do
It 's your life , and you can do what you wanna do .
Do what you like , but please don't keep me waitin '
Please don't keep me waitin ' ,
Cuz im so tired , tired of waiting , tired of waiting for you .
So tired , tired of waiting , tired of waiting for you .
I was a lonely soul , I had nobody ' till I met you .
But you , keeping me waiting , all of the time
What can I do
It 's your life , and you can do what you wanna do .
Do what you like , but please don't keep me waitin ' .
Please don't keep me waitin ' .
Cuz im so tired , tired of waiting , tired of waiting for you .
So tired , tired of waiting , tired of waiting for you .
For you
Exactly just what he became
It goes to show
It wasn't long ago
I was just like you
And now I think I 'm sick and I wanna go home
How have I been , how have you been
It 's been so long
What have you done with all your time
And what went wrong
I knew you back when
And you . you knew me
And now I think I 'm sick and I wanna go home
Anybody ever say no
Ever tell you that you weren't right
Where did all the little kid go
Did you lose it in a hateful fight
And you know it 's true
It wasn't long ago
I was just like you
And now I think I 'm sick and I wanna go home
Keep that in mind , I designed this rhyme when I was obsessed with time
All I know
Time was just slippin ' away
And I watched it count down till the end of the day
Watched it watched me and the words that I say
The echo of the clock rhythm in my vines
I know I didn't look out below when I watched the time go right out the window
Try to grab hold , tried not to watch
I wasted it all on while my hands ' on the clock
But in the end no matter what I pretend
The journey is more important than the end ( or the start )
And what it meant to me will eventually be a memory
Of a time that I tried so hard ( hard , hard , hard )
And I got so far
but in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
but in the end it doesn't even matter
Aiyyo One thing I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try ( hard you try )
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme to explain in due time
All I know , ha ! I socialize like the host of a party
spoke , shake and made eye contact , party that toast all format
North-east , south-west coast
I stand out the window , no opportunity ta mend though
I tried sole them (?)
I brought you back to the things
Like an imaginary man of your dreams
Who 'd seem to make it worth it
A pig skin ? I never nerfed it
(?)
By any means , it means I 'm leaving your team
Follow the team , baby it seems I 've tried so hard .
[ Chorus ]
Linkin Park ( Remix ) with Motion Man ,
Linkin Park ( In The End ) and Kutmaster Kurt ( x2 ) .
One thing I don't know how
It doesn't even while you look at it now
Cuz when I designed this rhyme
I was scared of it all , scared to fall
And haven't even try to crawl
And I was forced to run
Wit'chu mockin me , stopping me , backstabbing me constantly
Constantly remembering all the times you fought with me
Watch the clock chalk , mock , full of hypocrisy
And now your mouth wishes it could inhale
Every single little thing that you said that could make things fail
Every single word you sputted just to get your piece
But it really doensn't matter to me
Cuz from the start till the end no matter what I pretend
The journey is more important than the end from the start
And what it meant to me will eventually be a memory
Of a time that I trid so hard
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even mater
In the eeeeennnnnddddd .
Hand grenade pins in every line
Throw ' em up and let something shine
Going out of my fucking mind
Filthy mouth , no excuse
Find a new place to hang this noose
String me up from atop these roofs
Knot it tight so i won't get loose
Truth is you can stop and stare
Bled myself out and no one cares
Dug the trench out laid down there
With a shovel up out of reach somewhere
Yeah , someone pour it in
Make it a dirt dance floor again
Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in
[ Chorus ]
I bleed it out digging deeper
Just to throw it away
I bleed it out digging deeper
Just to throw it away
I bleed it out digging deeper
Just to throw it away
I bleed it out
[ End Chorus ]
Go stop the show
Choppy words and a sloppy flow
Shotgun opera lock and load
Cock it back and then watch it go
Mama help me I 've been cursed
Death is rolling in every verse
Candy paint on his brand new hearse
Can't contain him he knows he works
Fuck this hurts I won't lie
Doesn't matter how hard I try
Half the words don't mean a thing
And I know that I wont be satisfied
So why try ignoring him
Make it a dirt dance floor again
Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in
[ Chorus ]
I bleed it out digging deeper
Just to throw it away
I bleed it out digging deeper
Just to throw it away
I bleed it out digging deeper
Just to throw it away
I bleed it out
I 've opened up these scars
I 'll make you face this
I pull myself apart
I 'll make you , face , this , now !
[ Chorus ]
I bleed it out digging deeper
Just to throw it away
I bleed it out digging deeper
Just to throw it away
I bleed it out digging deeper
Just to throw it away
I bleed it out digging deeper
Just to throw it away
I bleed it out digging deeper
Just to throw it away
I bleed it out digging deeper
Just to throw it away
I bleed it out
I met her on the eve of my birthday .
Did she know , did she know , before she went away , does she know
But it 's too darn late
This girl has gone far away .
Now she 's gone .
All I have now is a memory to date .
A cheap hat and cigarettes , and a peculiar name .
I didn't know , I didn't know , before she went away .
I know now , I know now , and it 's too darn late .
Will she ever find her way
I 'm too darn young to be too late , but am I
Yet again I 'm kicking myself , and I 'll be here in battle scars , waiting for you .
Waiting for you now .
Such a sight for sore eyes , you 're a suicide makeover .
Plastic eyes , lookin ' through a numbskull .
Self-effaced , what 's his face .
You erased yourself so shut up .
You don't let up .
You have a growth that must be treated
Like a severed severe pain in the neck .
You can smell it but you can't see it .
No explanation identified ' cause you don't know .
You don't say .
And you got no reply .
Hey you , where did you come from
Got a head full of lead , you 're a inbred bastard son .
All dressed up , red blooded , Amannequin
Do or die , no reply , don't deny that you 're synthetic .
You 're pathetic .
Till I find you
You say you want to leave me
But you can't choose
I 've gone thru pain
Every day and night
I feel my mind is going insane
Something I can't fight
Don't leave me
A blank expression
Covering your face
I 'm looking for directions
For out of this place
I start to wonder
If you 'll come back
I feel the rain storming after thunder
I can't hold back
Don't leave me
I 'll go for miles
Till I find you
You say you want to leave me
But you can't choose
I 've gone thru pain
Every day and night
I feel my mind is going insane
Something I can't fight
Don't leave me
Doesn't mean I 'm lost
Doesn't mean I 'll stop
Doesn't mean I would cross
Just because I 'm hurting
Doesn't mean I 'm hurt
Doesn't mean I didn't get
What I deserved
No better and no worse
I just got lost
Every river that I tried to cross
Every door I ever tried was locked
Ohhh and I 'm .
Just waiting ' til the shine wears off
You might be a big fish
In a little pond
Doesn't mean you 've won
' Cause along may come
A bigger one
And you 'll be lost
Every river that you tried to cross
Every gun you ever held went off
Ohhh and I 'm .
Just waiting until the firing stopped
Ohhh and I 'm .
Just waiting ' til the shine wears off
[ piano solo ]
Ohhh and I .
Just waiting ' til the shine wears off
Ohhh and I .
Just waiting ' til the shine wears off
And now he 's gone and all they say ,
Is you gotta live cause life goes on
But now I see i 'm mortal too
I can't live my life like you
Gotta live it up while life goes on
And I think it 's alright
That I do what I like cause that 's the way I wanna live
And so I give
And i 'm still giving
And now I wonder about my friend
If he gave all he could give
Cause he lived his life like I live mine
If you could see inside my head
Then you 'd start to understand
The things I value in my heart
You know that ,
I know that ,
Your watching me
Gotta make a plan
Gotta do what 's right
Can't run around in circles
If you wanna build a life
But I don't wanna make a plan
For a day far away
While i 'm young and while i 'm able
All I wanna do is .
Bottom to top I stop
At the core I 've forgotten
In the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety
The picture is there
The memory won't escape me
But why should I care
[ Chorus x2 ]
There 's a place so dark you can't see the end
Skies cock back and shock that which can't defend
The rain then sends dripping / acidic question
Forcefully , the power of suggestion
Then with the eyes shut / looking thought the rust and rot
And dust / a small spot of light floods the floor
And pours over the rusted world of pretend
The eyes ease open and its dark again
[ Chorus x1 ]
In the memory you 'll find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up
Moving all around / screaming of the ups and downs
Pollution manifested in perpetual sound
The wheels go round and the sunset creeps behind
Street lamps , chain-link and concrete
A little piece of paper with a picture drawn floats
On down the street till the wind is gone
The memory now is like the picture was then
When the paper 's crumpled up it can't be perfect again
[ Chorus x2 ]
In the memory you 'll find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up
Now you got me caught in the act
You bring the thought back
I 'm telling you that
I see it right through you
[ x7 ]
In the memory you 'll find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up
[ x2 ]
Come on
I woke up in a dream today
To the cold and the static
And I put my cold feet on the floor
Forgot all about yesterday
Remembering I 'm pretending to be where I 'm not anymore
A little taste of hipocrisy
And I 'm left in the wake of the mistake
Slow to react
Even though you 're so close to me
You 're still so distant
And I can't bring you back
It 's true
The way I feel
Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories
Even if you 're not with me
I 'm with you
You , now I see
Keeping everything inside
With You
You , now I see
Even when I close my eyes
With you
You , now I see
Keeping everything inside
With You
You , now I see
Even when I close my eyes
I hit you and you hit me back
We fall to the floor
The rest of the day stands still
Fine line between this and that
But when things go wrong
I pretend that the past isn't real
I 'm trapped in this memory
And I 'm left in the wake of the mistake
Slow to react
Even though you 're so close to me
You 're still so distant
And I can't bring you back
It 's true
The way I feel
Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories
Even if you 're not with me
I 'm with you
You , now I see
Keeping everything inside
With You
You , now I see
Even when I close my eyes
With you
You , now I see
Keeping everything inside
With You
You , now I see
Even when I close my eyes
No , I won't let you control my fate
While I 'm holding the wait of the world on my conscience
No , I won't just sit here and wait
While you wear your options
You 're making a fool of me
No , you didn't dare try to say that you don't care
And solemnly swear not to follow me there
No , it ain't like me to beg on my knees
Oh , please , oh , baby , please
That 's not how I 'm doing things
No , I 'm not upset
No , I 'm not angry
I know love is love , love
Sometimes it pains me
With or without you
I 'll always be with you
You 'll never forget me
I 'm keeping you with me
No , I won't let you take me to the end of my rope
While you burn and torture my soul
No , I 'm not your puppet
And , no , no , no , I won't let you go
No , no matter how far we 've come
I can't wait to see tomorrow
No matter how far we 've come , I
I can't wait to see tomorrow
With you
You , now I see
Keeping everything inside
With You
You , now I see
Even when I close my eyes
With you
You , now I see
Keeping everything inside
With You
You , now I see
Even when I close my eyes
Everything is what I want it to be ,
I looked exactly like what you always wanted to see ,
When I pretend ,
I can't forget about the criminal I am ,
Stealing second after second just cause I know I can ,
But I can't pretend that this is the way , it 'll stay , I 'm just ,
( Trying to bend the truth )
I can't pretend I 'm who you want me to be so I 'm ,
( Lying my way from )
You !
( No , no turning back now )
I wanna be pushed aside , so let me go !
( No , no turning back now )
Let me take back my life
I 'd rather be , all alone !
( No turning back now )
Anywhere on my own , cause I can see !
( No , no turning back now )
The very worse part of you
IS ME
I remember what they taught to me ,
Remember condescending talk ,
Of who I ought to be ,
Remember listening to all of that ,
And this again ,
So I pretended up a person who was fitting in ,
And now you think this person ,
Really is me and I 'm ,
( Trying to bend the truth )
The more I push ,
The more I 'm pulling away ,
Cause I 'm ,
( Lying my way from )
You !
( No , no turning back now )
I wanna be pushed aside , so let me go !
( No , no turning back now )
Let me take back my life ,
I 'd rather be , all alone !
( No turning back now )
Anywhere on my own , cause I can see !
( No , no turning back now )
The very worse part of you
IS ME !
This isn't what I wanted to be ,
I never thought that what I said ,
Would have you running from me ,
LIKE THIS !
This isn't what I wanted to be ,
I never thought that what I said ,
Would have you running from me ,
LIKE THIS !
This isn't what I wanted to be ,
I never thought that what I said ,
Would have you running from me ,
LIKE THIS !
This isn't what I wanted to be ,
I never thought that what I said ,
Would have you running from me ,
LIKE THIS !
YOU !
( No , no turning back now )
I wanna be pushed aside , so let me go !
( No , no turning back now )
Let me take back my life ,
I 'd rather be all alone !
( No turning back now )
Anywhere on my own , cause I can see !
( No , no turning back now )
The very worse part of you
IS ME !
Stuart and the Avenue
Ripping up my transfer
And a photograph of you
You 're a blur of my dead past and rotting existance
As I stand laughing on the corner of insignificance
Well , Destiny is dead
In the hands of bad luck
Before it might have made some sense
But now it 's all freaked up
Seasons change as well as minds
And I 'm a two faced clown
You 're mommy 's little nightmare
Driving daddy 's car around
I 'm beat down and half brain dead
The long lost king of fools
I may be dumb
But I 'm not stupid enough to stay with you
Well , Destiny is dead
In the hands of bad luck
Before it might have made some sense
But now it 's all freaked up
Well , Destiny is dead
In the hands of bad luck
Before it might have made some sense
But now it 's all freaked up
All freaked up .
When you get what you want , but not what you need
When you feel so tired , but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse
When the tears come streaming down your face
When you lose something you can't replace
When you love someone , but it goes to waste
Could it be worse ?
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you
High up above or down below
When you too in love to let it go
If you never try you 'll never know
Just what you 're worth
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you
Tears stream down your face
When you lose something you cannot replace
Tears stream down your face
And I .
Tears stream down on your face
I promise you I will learn from the mistakes
Tears stream down your face
And I .
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you
I got your getaway ,
I 'm on a second trail ,
As clear as crystal .
But it was harmless ,
It couldn't hurt you ,
Oh you were helpless ,
I know you 'll get through .
I 'm curious to know exactly how you are
I keep my distance but that distance is too far
It reassures me just to know that you 're okay
But I don't want you to go on needing me this way
( Chorus )
( And I )
Don't wanna know if you are lonely
Don't wanna know if you are less than lonely
Don't wanna know if you are lonely
Don't wanna know , don't want to know
( Verse 2 )
The day you left me left me feeling oh so bad
Still I 'm not sure about all the doubts we had
From the beginning we both knew it wouldn't last
Decisions have been made , the die has been cast
( Chorus )
( Bridge )
( Verse 3 )
The phone is ringing and the clock says 4 AM
If it 's your friends , well I don't wanna hear from them
So leave your number and a message at the tone
Or you can just go on and leave me here alone
( Chorus )
I don't need your authority
Down with the moral majority
' Cause I want to be the minority
I pledge allegiance to the underworld
One nation under dog
There of which I stand alone
A face in the crowd
Unsung , against the mold
Without a doubt
Singled out
The only way I know
I want to be the minority
I don't need your authority
Down with the moral majority
' Casue I want to be the minority
Stepped out of the line
Like a sheep runs from the herd
Marching out of time
To my own beat now
The only way I know
One light , one mind
Flashing in the dark
Blinded by the silence of a thousand broken hearts
" For crying out loud " she screamed unto me
A free for all
F * ' em all
You are your own sight
I want to be the minority
I don't need your authority
Down with the moral majority
' Cause I want to be the minority
I 'd like to break you freaking teeth .
Stick a knife in the center of your back .
You better grow some eyes in the back of your head .
I fight dirty , just like your looks .
Can't take , can't take , can't take anymore .
Take back , Take back , Take .
The taste of bad blood on the tip of my tongue .
An eye for an eye .
Gun for a gun .
Cold-cocked and I 'm taking back what 's mine .
Expect it when you 're least expecting it .
No loss of love , the smell of regret .
Lights out
Can't take anymore
shoot
Don't ask me where I 'm at
' Cause I 'm a million miles away
Treated like a forbidden heel
Don't say my thoughts are not for real
Or you won't see me again
Am I here or am I there
Or am I playing on the stairs
Am I in my room with my toys
I am the disappearing boy
When I walk in crowded rooms
I feel as if it is my doom
I know that I don't belong
In that room I see her
I see her and she 's with him
I turn and then I 'm gone
Don't call me up ' cause I 'm not home
My whereabouts are now unknown
I vanished from all your joy
I 'm the disappearing boy
I have my doubts
Of where I belong
It 's something to think about
Don't call me up ' cause I 'm not home
My whereabouts are now unknown
I vanished from all your joy
I 'm the disappearing boy
I WANNA BE ALONE
With you around , you 'll only add on
I WANNA BE ALONE
Its been disturbed by my thoughts
I WANNA BE ALONE
With you around , you 'll only add on
I WANNA BE ALONE
Please don't think I 'm crazy
I don't want you to understand
My mind is growing hazy
To heck with your helping hand
Why don't you just leave me alone
This conflict is my own
Keep your sources away from me
That 's all
I lock myself inside my room
I WANNA BE ALONE
With you around , you 'll only add on
I WANNA BE ALONE
Its been disturbed by my thoughts
I WANNA BE ALONE
With you around , you 'll only add on
I WANNA BE ALONE
Please don't think I 'm crazy
I don't want you to understand
My mind is growing hazy
To heck with your helping hand
Why don't you just leave me alone
This conflict is my own
Keep your sources away from me
That 's all
I lock myself inside my room
I WANNA BE ALONE
With you around , you 'll only add on
I WANNA BE ALONE
Its been disturbed by my thoughts
I WANNA BE ALONE
With you around , you 'll only add on
I WANNA BE ALONE
Please don't think I 'm crazy
I don't want you to understand
My mind is growing hazy
To heck with your helping hand
Why don't you just leave me alone
This conflict is my own
Keep your sources away from me
That 's all
look at you
Well that all right pretty baby , cuz I 'm just
looking for something to do
You 're telling me that you don't feel the
same
Well that 's all right pretty baby , cuz I don't
mind driving myself insane , sometimes
I don't mind at all , and then again
sometimes baby
I feel like my whole world 's gonna fall apart
When you tell me you don't feel the same ,
but that 's all right pretty baby , cuz I don't
mind being insane
Sometimes
You don't talk to me no more , and I don't
talk to you
Well that 's all right pretty baby , cuz I 'm just
looking for something to prove
You 're telling me that you don't feel the
same
Well that 's all right pretty baby , cuz I don't
mind driving myself insane , sometimes
I don't mind at all , and then again
sometimes baby
I feel like my whole worlds gonna fall apart
When you tell me that you don't feel the
same , but that 's all right pretty baby , cuz
I don't mind being insane
Sometimes
It 's news that I for thought
Was it just a dream that happened long ago
I think that I just forgot
Well it hasn't been the first time
And it sure does drive me mad
There 's a boy who fogs his world and now he 's getting lazy
There 's no motivation and frustration makes him crazy
He makes a plan to take a stand but always ends up sitting .
Someone help him up or he 's gonna end up quitting
I shuffle through my mind
To see if I can find
The words I left behind
Was it just a dream that happened long ago
Oh well .
Never mind .
Well it hasn't been the first time
And it sure does drive me mad
There 's a boy who fogs his world and now he 's getting lazy
There 's no motivation and frustration makes him crazy
He makes a plan to take a stand but always ends up sitting .
Someone help him up or he 's gonna end up quitting
There 's a boy who fogs his world and now he 's getting lazy
There 's no motivation and frustration makes him crazy
He makes a plan to take a stand but always ends up sitting .
Someone help him up or he 's gonna end up quitting
There 's a boy who fogs his world and now he 's getting lazy
There 's no motivation and frustration makes him crazy
He makes a plan to take a stand but always ends up sitting .
Someone help him up or he 's gonna end up quitting
Look how they shine for you ,
And everything you do ,
Yeah , they were all yellow .
I came along ,
I wrote a song for you ,
And all the things you do ,
And it was called " Yellow " .
So then I took my turn ,
Oh what a thing to have done ,
And it was all " Yellow . "
Jeg sked ,
ja jeg sked en bums ,
Turn into something beautiful ,
You know , you know I love you so ,
You know I love you so .
I swam across ,
I jumped across for you ,
Oh what a thing to do .
Cos you were all " Yellow " ,
I drew a line ,
I drew a line for you ,
Oh what a thing to do ,
And it was all " Yellow . "
Jeg sked ,
ja jeg sked en bums ,
Turn into something beautiful ,
And you know ,
For you I 'd bleed myself dry ,
For you I 'd bleed myself dry .
It 's true ,
Look how they shine for you ,
Look how they shine for ,
Look how they shine for you ,
Look how they shine .
Look at the stars ,
Look how they shine for you ,
And all the things that you do .
Then it turned out to only be a dream
I made a point to burn all of the photographs
She went away and then I took a different path
I remember the face but I can't recall the name
Now I wonder how whatsername has been
Seems that she disappeared without a trace
Did she ever marry old what 's his face ?
I made a point to burn all of the photographs
She went away and then I took a different path
I remember the face but I can't recall the name
Now I wonder how whatsername has been
Remember , whatever
It seems like forever ago
Remember , whatever
It seems like forever ago
The regrets are useless
In my mind
She 's in my head
I must confess
The regrets are useless
In my mind
She 's in my head
From so long ago
( Go , Go , Go , Go . )
And in the darkest night
If my memory serves me right
I 'll never turn back time
Forgetting you , but not the time .
Your clothes are different ,
but you 're still the same
Why else would you come here
Scumbag on a mission
You 're telling me it 's been a while
Shinning a grin and a brand new life
Somebodys let you come here
Scumbag with ambission
Never though I 'd see the like of you around this place
What 's the special occasion
Did you run outta friends
Hear you are , come around again
Things are different butcha still pretend
You gotta reason to come here
Scumbag with ambission
And , you 're telling me , things will change
And you 'll leaving in a couple days
You 're gonna change the world someday
Scumbag with a vision
It must be nice to know you got it all figured out
From the wear of sin
It 's the same thing again and again
Have you ever stopped and thinked ,
before you opened up your mouth
Beacuase everytime you do ,
It 's the same thing again and again
Wondering what I think of you and I protect you out of courtesy
Too many times that I 've held on what I needed to push away
Afraid to say what was on my mind afraid to say what I need to say
Too many things that you said about me when I 'm not around
You think having the upper hand means you gotta keep putting me down
But I 've had too many standoffs with you it 's about as much as I can stand
So I 'm waiting until the upper hand is mine
( One minute you 're on top )
Next you 're not watch you drop
( Making your heart stop )
Just before you hit the floor
( One minute you 're on top )
Next you 're not missed a shot
( Making you 're heart stop )
You think you 've won
( And then it 's all gone )
So many people like me put so much trust in all your lies
So concerned with what you think to just say what we feel inside
So many people like me walk on eggshells all day long
All I know is that all I want is to feel like I 'm not stepped on
There are so many things you say that make me feel you crossed the line
What goes up will surely fall and I 'm counting down the time
Cause I 've had so many standoffs with you it 's about as much as I can stand
So I 'm waiting until the upper hand is mine
( One minute you 're on top )
Next you 're not watch you drop
( Making your heart stop )
Just before you hit the floor
( One minute you 're on top )
Next you 're not missed a shot
( Making you 're heart stop )
You think you 've won
( And then it 's all gone )
( And then he 's all gone )
( And then it 's all gone )
( And then he 's all gone )
( Now it 's all gone )
I know I 'll never trust a single thing you say
You knew your lies would divide us but you lied anyway
And all the lies have got you floating up above us all
But what goes up has got to fall
( One minute you 're on top )
Next you 're not watch you drop
( Making your heart stop )
Just before you hit the floor
( One minute you 're on top )
Next you 're not missed a shot
( Making you 're heart stop )
You think you 've won
( And then it 's all gone )
( And then he 's all gone )
( And then it 's all gone )
( And then he 's all gone )
( Now it 's all gone )
What the next man thinks of me
I 'll never do exactly what I want
And I 'll sculpt my life for your acceptance
I always waste my time just wondering
What the next man thinks of me
I 'll never do exactly what I want
And I 'll sculpt my life for your acceptance
And I feel forgotten
Feel like rotting
( Do you feel the same )
Adolescence
Just can't make sense
( It 's calling my name )
I take a look around
And all the things I 've found
I call it blind hatred
If you 'd stop a while
And maybe if you 'd smile
You would realize that
We 're all the same
It 's just like our brain
When it apes insane
We feel the same pain
All my life I 've seemed to have this need
I think at times it even turns to greed
We all want to join some family
We 'll even sacrifice a moral changing
And I feel forgotten
Feel like rotting
( Do you feel the same )
Adolescence
Just can't make sense
( It 's calling my name )
I take a look around
And all the things I 've found
I call it blind hatred
If you 'd stop a while
And maybe if you 'd smile
You would realize that
We 're all the same
It 's just like our brain
When it apes insane
We feel the same pain
I take a look around
And all the things I 've found
I call it blind hatred
If you 'd stop a while
And maybe if you 'd smile
You would realize that
We 're all the same
It 's just like our brain
When it apes insane
We feel the same pain
Let me apologize for what I 'm about to say
But trying to be genuine was harder than it seemed
And somehow I got caught up in between
Let me apologize to begin with
Let me apologize for what I 'm about to say
But trying to be someone else was harder than it seemed
And somehow I got caught up in between
[ Chorus ]
Between my pride and my promise
Between my lies and how the truth gets in the way
And things I want to say to you get lost before they come
The only thing that 's worse than one is none
[ End Chorus ]
Let me apologize to begin with
Let me apologize for what I 'm about to say
But trying to regain your trust was harder than it seemed
And somehow I got caught up in between
[ Chorus ]
Between my pride and my promise
Between my lies and how the truth gets in the way
The things I want to say to you get lost before they come
The only thing that 's worse than one is none
[ End Chorus ]
And I cannot explain to you
And anything I say or do or plan
Fear is not afraid of you
But guilt 's a language you can understand
I cannot explain to you
And anything I say or do
I hope the actions speak the words they can
[ Chorus ]
For my pride and my promise
For my lies and how the truth gets in the way
The things I want to say to you get lost before they come
The only thing that 's worse than one is
Pride and my promise
Between my lies and how the truth gets in the way
The things I want to say to you get lost before they come
The only thing that 's worse than one is none
[ End Chorus ]
Beyond the shadow of a doubt
Withe my conscienece beating
Like the puls of a drum
That hammers on and on
Until I reach the break of the day
As the sun beats down
The halfway house
Has my conscience beating
The sound in my ear
The will tomperserve
As I reach the break of the day
When you lost all hope and excuses
And the cheapstakes & losers
Nothing 's left to cling onto
You got to hold on yourself
A cry of hope
A plea for peace
And my conscience beating
It 's not what I want for
It 's all that I need
To reach the break of the Day
So I run to the edge
Beyond the shadowas of a doubt
With my conscience bleeding
Here lies the truth
The lost treasures of my youth
As I hold on to the break of the day
When you lost all hope and excuses
And the cheapstakes & losers
Nothing 's left to cling onto
You got to hold on yourself
When you lost all hope and excuses
And the cheapstakes & losers
Nothing 's left to cling onto
You got to hold on yourself
Myself
What do I do to ingore them behind me
Do I follow my instincts blindly
Do I hide my pride from these bad dreams
And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening
Do I sit here and try to stand it
Or do I try to catch them red-handed
Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness
Or do I trust nobody and live in lonliness
Because I can't hold on when I 'm stretched so thin
I make the right moves but I 'm lost within
I put on my daily facade but then
I just end up getting hurt again
By myself
Myself
I ask why
But in my mind I find
I can't rely on myself
Myself
I ask why
But in my mind I find
I can't rely on myself
I can't look around
It 's too much to take in
I can't hold back
When I 'm stretched so thin
I can't slow down
Watching everything spin
I can't look back
Starting over again
If I turn my back I 'm defenceless
And to go blindly seems senceless
If I hide my pride and let it all go on
Then they 'll take from me ' til everything is gone
If I let them go I 'll be outdone
But if I try to catch them I 'll be outrun
If I 'm killed by the questions like a cancer
Then I 'll be buried in the silence of the answer
By myself
Myself
I ask why
But in my mind I find
I can't rely on myself
Myself
I ask why
But in my mind I find
I can't rely on myself
I can't look around
It 's too much to take in
I can't hold back
When I 'm stretched so thin
I can't slow down
Watching everything spin
I can't look back
Starting over again
Don't you know
I can't tell you how to make it go
No matter what I do , how hard I try
I can't seem to convince myself why
I 'm stuck on the outside
Don't you know
I can't tell you how to make it go
No matter what I do , how hard I try
I can't seem to convince myself why
I 'm stuck on the outside
Don't you know
I can't tell you how to make it go
No matter what I do , how hard I try
I can't seem to convince myself why
I 'm stuck on the outside
Don't you know
I can't tell you how to make it go
No matter what I do , how hard I try
I can't seem to convince myself why
I 'm stuck on the outside
Don't you know
I can't tell you how to make it go
No matter what I do , how hard I try
I can't seem to convince myself why
I 'm stuck on the outside
Don't you know
I can't tell you how to make it go
No matter what I do , how hard I try
I can't seem to convince myself why
I 'm stuck on the outside
WASTING YOUR TIME
No obligation , just
WASTING YOUR TIME
So why are you alone
WASTING YOUR TIME
When you could be with me
WASTING YOUR TIME
Well , I 'm a WASTE like you
With nothing else to do
May I WASTE your time too
Warding off regrets
WASTING YOUR TIME
Smoking cigarettes
WASTING YOUR TIME
I 'm just a PARASITE
WASTING YOUR TIME
APPLYING myself to
WASTING YOUR TIME
Well , I 'm a WASTE like you
With nothing else to do
May I WASTE your time too
So why are you alone
WASTING YOUR TIME
When you could be with me
WASTING YOUR TIME
Well , I 'm a WASTE like you
With nothing else to do
May I WASTE your time too
I saw sun rise , I saw sunlight
I am nothing , in the dark
And the clouds burst to show a daylight
Oooooo and the sun shines , Yeaaahhh on this star of mine
Oooooo and I realise , Oooooo couldn't live without
Oooooo couldn't part without , it
On a hill top , on a sky rise
Like a first born , child
At a full tilt , and at full flight
You see darkness , in the daylight
Oooooo and the sun shines , Yeaaahhh on this star of mine
Oooooo and I realise , Oooooo couldn't be without
Oooooo couldn't part without , daylight
Slowly breaking through the daylight [ x22 to fade ]
Tides that I tried to swim against
You 've put me down upon my knees
Oh I beg , I beg and plead ( singing )
Come out of things unsaid , shoot an apple of my head ( and a )
Trouble that can't be named , tigers waiting to be tamed ( singing )
You are , you are
Confusion never stops , closing walls and ticking clocks ( gonna )
Come back and take you home , I could not stop , that you now know ( singing )
Come out upon my seas , curse missed opportunities ( am I )
A part of the cure , or am I part of the disease ( singing )
You are [ x6 ]
And nothing else compares
Oh no nothing else compares
And nothing else compares
You are [ continues in background ]
Home , home , where I wanted to go [ x4 ]
There 's no blood
There 's no alibi
Cause I 've drawn regret
From the truth
Of a thousand lies
[ Pre-Chorus :]
So let mercy come
And wash away
What I 've done
[ Chorus :]
I 'll face myself
To cross out what i 've become
Erase myself
And let go of what i 've done
Put to rest
What you thought of me
While I clean this slate
With the hands of uncertainty
[ Pre-Chorus ]
[ Chorus ]
For what I 've done
I start again
And whatever pain may come
Today this ends
I 'm forgiving what I 've done !
[ Chorus ]
What I 've done
Forgiving what I 've done
As soon as your born they make you feel small
By giving you no time instead of it all
Till the pain is so big you feel nothing at all
A working class hero is something to be
They hurt you at home and they hit you at school
They hate if you 're clever and they despise a fool
Till you 're so fucking crazy you can't follow their rules
A working class hero is something to be
When they 've tortured and scared you for twenty odd years
Then they expect you to pick a career
When you can't really function you 're so full of fear
A working class hero is something to be
Keep you doped with religion and sex and TV ,
And you think you 're so clever and you 're classless and free ,
But you 're still fucking peasants as far as I can see ,
A working class hero is something to be
There 's room at the top they are telling you still
But first you must learn how to smile as you kill
If you want to be like all the folks on the hill
A working class hero is something to be
If you want to be a hero , well just follow me
Something in here 's not right today
Why am I so uptight today
Paranoia 's all I got left
I don't know what stressed me first
Or how the pressure was fed / but
I know just what it feels like
To have a voice in the back of my head
It 's like a face that I hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face watches every time I lie
A face that laughs every time I fall
( And watches everything )
So I know that when it 's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is hearing me / right beneath my skin
It 's like I 'm / paranoid lookin ' over my back
It 's like a / whirlwind inside of my head
It 's like I / can't stop what I 'm hearing within
It 's like the face inside is right beneath my skin
I know I 've got a face in me
points out all the mistakes to me
You 've got a face on the inside too and
Your paranoia 's probably worse
I don't know what set me off first but I know what I can't stand
Everybody acts like the fact of the matter is
I can't add up to what you can but
Everybody has a face that they hold inside
A face that awakes when they close their eyes
A face watches every time they lie
A face that laughs every time they fall
( And watches everything )
So you know that when it 's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is watching you too / right inside your skin
The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me
When you commit the crime
Shoplifter , you 're getting burned
And now you gotta do the time
It 's a 1 , 2 , 3 on the felony
Well not everything is free
Now that you served the community
It 's the life of a petty thief
It 's not considered stealing
Unless you 're getting caught
But you 'll be caught stealing
Tryin ' to take something you haven't got
Shoplifter , you 'll never learn
What lies behind your back
Not a burgler or a bankrobber
Just a kleptomaniac
It 's not considered stealing
Unless you 're getting caught
But you 'll be caught stealing
Tryin ' to take something you haven't got
Shoplifter , you 'll never learn
When you commit the crime
Shoplifter , you 're getting burned
And now you gotta do the time
Oh now you gotta do the time
Well now you gotta do some time
The shoot so deep you can't run away
I beg to differ on the contrary
I agree with every word that you say
Talk is cheap and lies are expensive
My wallet 's fat and so is my head
Hit and run and then I 'll hit you again
I 'm a smart butt but I 'm playing dumb
Standards set and broken all the time
Control the chaos behind a gun
Call it as I see it even if
I was born deaf , blind and dumb
Losers winning big on the lottery
Rehab rejects still sniffing glue
Constant refutation with myself
I 'm a vicitm of a catch 22
I have no belief
But I believe
I 'm a walking contradiction
And I ain't got no right
Do as I say not as I do because
The shoot so deep you can't run away
I beg to differ on the contrary
I agree with every word that you say
Talk is cheap and lies are expensive
My wallet 's fat and so is my head
Hit and run and then I 'll hit you again
I 'm a smart butt but I 'm playing dumb
I have no belief
But I believe
I 'm a walking contradiction
And I ain't got no right
I have no belief
But I believe
I 'm a walking contradiction
And I ain't got no right
It 's the time of your lives , it 's the time of your lives ,
Breakdown , breakdown ,
Got to spread love around , got to spread love around .
Brothers and sisters feel fine ,
It 's the time of your life , it 's the time of your life ,
No sound , No sound ,
Like this feeling you found , like this feeling you found ,
Just stay down , cos sometimes you feel , so stay down .
Sometimes you feel .
And it 's me they 're looking for ,
And it 's me I will never survive ,
But will be around so long .
Brothers and sisters unite .
Just stay down ,
And sometimes you feel ,
Just stay down ,
And sometimes you feel ,
And it 's me they 're looking for ,
And it 's me , I will never survive ,
But will be round so long .
Are you in a hurry
I need a lift to happy hour .
Say oh no .
Do you brake for distilled spirits
I need a break as well .
The well that inebriates the guilt .
1 , 2 . 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 .
Cold turkey 's getting stale , tonight I 'm eating crow .
Fermented salmonella poison oak no
There 's a drought at the fountain of youth , and now I 'm dehydrating .
My tongue is swelling up , as say 1 , 2 . 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 .
Troubled times , you know i can not lie .
I 'm off the wagon and I 'm hitchin ' a ride .
There 's a drought at the fountain of youth , and now I 'm dehydrating .
My tongue is swelling up , I say shoot !
I hope we get old ,
I hope we can find a way of seeing it all .
Love ,
I hope we can be ,
I hope I can find a way of letting you see ,
That I 'm so easy to please , so easy .
Love ,
I hope we grow old ,
I hope we can find a way of seeing it all .
Love ,
I hope we can be
I hope I can find a way of letting you see
That I 'm so easy to please , so easy .
Circumnavigate the globe ,
All you ever have to hope ,
For two ,
And the way you seem to flow
Circumnavigate and hope ,
If you seem to lose control ,
Wherever you are
Everyone of us is high ,
Everyone of us is low ,
Everyone of us is here ,
How about you ?
Your eyes are closed ,
Your head held low ,
Your eyes are closed .
Everyone of us is high ,
Everyone of us is low ,
Everyone of us has hope ,
For you .
You know I 'll be there
If you go far ,
You know I 'll be there
I 'll go anywhere ,
So I 'll see you there
You place the name
You know I 'll be there
You name the time
You know I 'll be there
I 'll go anywhere
So I 'll see you there
I don't care if you don't mind
I 'll be there not far behind
I will dare
Keep in mind
I 'll be there for you
Where there 's truth
You know I 'll be there
Amongst the lies
You know I 'll be there
I 'll go anywhere
So I 'll see you there
I don't care if you don't mind
I 'll be there not far behind
I will dare
Keep in mind
I 'll be there for you
If you should fall
You know I 'll be there
To catch the call
You I 'll be there
I 'll go anywhere
So I 'll see you there
I don't care if you don't mind
I 'll be there not far behind
I will dare
Keep in mind
I don't care
I 'll be there for you
Did you lose something the last time you were here
You 'll never find it now
It 's buried deep with your identity
So stand aside and let the next one pass
Don't let the door kick you in the butt
There 's no return from 86
Don't even try .
Exit out the back
And never show your head around again
Purchase your ticket
And quickly take the last train out of town
So stand aside and let the next one pass
Don't ket the door kick you in the butt
There 's no return from 86
Don't even try .
There 's no return from 86
Don't even try .
With a sad look on your face
You call him on the phone
Looks like he left you
Without a trace
Tears falling out of your eyes
He 's living in a disguise
You 've been feeling bad for so long
You wonder if it 's right or wrong
Why Do You Want Him
Now many days have gone by
And you still just sit there and cry
You 're feeling bad for yourself
His memory will always dwell
You 're so obsessed with his love
That 's why push came to shove
You 've been feeling bad for so long
You wonder if it 's right or wrong
Why Do You Want Him
You find a way out .
To throw it all the way
But you can bet .
You got someting to say
Why Do You Want Him
Mother , mother
There 's too many of you crying
Brother , brother , brother
There 's far too many of you dying
You know we 've got to find a way
To bring some lovin ' here today , yeah
Father , father
We don't need to escalate
You see , war is not the answer
For only love can conquer hate
You know we 've got to find a way
To bring some lovin ' here today
Picket lines and picket signs
Don't punish me with brutality
Talk to me , so you can see
Oh , what 's going on
What 's going on
Ya , what 's going on
Ah , what 's going on
In the mean time
Right on , baby
Right on
Father , father , everybody thinks we 're wrong
Oh , but who are they to judge us
Simply because our hair is long
Oh , you know we 've got to find a way
To bring some understanding here today
Oh
Picket lines and picket signs
Don't punish me with brutality
Talk to me
So you can see
What 's going on
Ya , what 's going on
Tell me what 's going on
I 'll tell you what 's going on - Uh
Right on baby
And she was in it again
She and I were in the sky
Flying hand in hand
I woke up in a cold sweat
Wishing she was by my side
Praying that she 'll dry tears
Left on my face I 've cried
Oh I love her
Keep dreaming of her
Will I understand
If she wants to be my friend
I 'll send a letter to that girl
Asking her to by my own
But my pen is writing wrong
So I 'll say it in a song
Oh I love you more right now
More than I 've ever loved before
Here 's those words straight from these lips
I 'll need you forever more .
Oh I love her
Keep dreaming of her
Will I understand
If she wants to be my friend
Oh I love her
Keep dreaming of her
Will I understand
If she wants to be my friend
The means of pain thats in my heart .
Late last night I had a dream
And she was in it again
She and I were in the sky
Flying hand in hand
I woke up in a cold sweat
Wishing she was by my side
Praying that she 'll dry tears
Left on my face I 've cried
Oh I love her
Keep dreaming of her
Will I understand
If she wants to be my friend
Oh I love her
Keep dreaming of her
Will I understand
If she wants to be my friend
The means of pain thats in my heart .
Wanna be on Solid Gold .
Wanna date a millonaire .
Wanna make people stare .

Gonna have some free cocaine .
Wanna wear my Calvin Kleins .
Then the world will be all mine .
I wanna be on TV .
Want people to know me .
I wanna be on TV .
Around me like a leech .
I think you 're just a problem ,
So stay the hell away from me because I don't believe in you .
And I wanna sit here all my life alone .
This may sound a little rough ,
Don't wanna fall in love .
Don't need security .
I ain't no dog without a bone .
Don't have no time for love .
So stay the fuck away from me because I don't believe in you ,
And I wanna sit here all my life alone .
This may sound a little rough .
Don't wanna fall in love .

And I don't know
Exactly just how he became
It goes to show
It wasn't that long ago
I was just like you
And now I think I 'm sick
And I wanna go home
How have I been how have you been
It 's been so long
What have you done with all your time
And what went wrong
I knew you back when
And knew
And now I think you 're sick
And I wanna go home
Anybody ever say no
Ever tell you that you weren't right
Where did all the little kid go
Did you lose it in a hateful fight
And you know it 's true
It wasn't that long ago
I was just like you
And now I think I 'm sick
And I wanna go home
But , I think I HATE you
You 're the reason for my misery
Strange how you 've become
my biggest enemy
And I 've never even seen your face
Maybe it 's just jealousy
Mixing up with a VIOLENT mind
A circumstance that doesn't make much SENSE
Or maybe I 'm just DUMB
You 're the cloud hanging out over my head
Hail comes crashing down
welting my face
MAGIC MAN , EGOCENTRIC PLASTIC MAN
Yet you still get one over on me
Maybe it 's just jealousy
Mixing up with a VIOLENT mind
A circumstance that doesn't make much SENSE
Or maybe I 'm just DUMB
I don't mind all the guys dancing with my girl
That 's fine , I know them all pretty well
And I know sometimes I must get out in the light
Better leave her behind where the kids are alright .
The kids are alright .
Sometimes , I know I gotta get away
Bells chime , I know I gotta get away
And I know if I don't , I 'll go out of my mind
Better leave her behind where the kids are alright .
The kids are alright .
I know if I go things would be a lot better for her
I had this plan but her folks wouldn't let her
I don't mind , I feel i gotta get away
Bells chime , i know I gotta get away
And I know if I don't I 'll go out of my fuckin ' mind
Better leave her behind where the kids are alright .
The kids are alright .
Into sight and sound
Of no return and no looking back or down
A conscientes objector to the
War that 's my mind
Leaving in the lurch and I 'm
Taking back what 's mine
I 'm on a mission
Into destination unkown
An expidition
Onto desolation road
Where I 'm a .
Castaway - going at it alone
Castaway - now I 'm on my own
Castaway - going at it alone
Castaway - now I 'm on my own
Lost and found , trouble bound
Castaway
I 'm riding on the night train and
Driving stolen cars
Testing my nerves out of the blvd .
Spontaneous combustion in the
Corners of my mind
Leaving in the lurch
And I 'm taking back what 's mine
I 'm on a mission
Into destination unkown
An expidition
Onto desolation road
Where I 'm a .
Castaway - going at it alone
Castaway - now I 'm on my own
Castaway - going at it alone
Castaway - now I 'm on my own
Lost and found , trouble bound
Castaway
How did you get your noose so tight
Like chewing on tinfoil , it 's so much fun
Gonna be dead before your gone
Cause look how things have gotten
And I 'll be happy so I won't pretend
And I 'll be cheering that you 're going down
And I 'll be laughing , I 'll be laughing
How many feelings can you steal
Gotta be part of your appeal
I can see through you cause you 're wearing thin
Like chewing on tinfoil once again
Ha Ha you 're dead
And I 'm so happy
In loving memory
Of your demise
When your ship is going down
I 'll go out and paint the town
Ha Ha you 're dead
( ha ha ha )
Ha Ha you 're dead
The joke is over
You were an asshole
And now you 're gone
As your ship is going down
I 'll stand by and watch you drown
Ha Ha you 're dead
You 're gonna be dead
Just remember what I said
Ha Ha you 're dead
Disjointed heart
I 've got no commitment
To my own flesh and blood
Left all alone
Far from my home
No one to hear me , to heal my ill heart , I
Keep it locked up inside
Cannot express
To the point I 've regressed
If anger 's a gift , then I guess I 've been blessed , I
Keep it locked up inside
Keep my distance from your lies
It 's too late to love me now
You helped me to show me
It 's too late to love me now
You don't take a word in
Breaking a part of my heart to find release
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace
Breaking a part of my heart to find release
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace
Breaking a part of my heart to find release ( Break )
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace ( Me )
Breaking a part of my heart to find release ( Too )
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace
Keep it locked up inside
Keep my distance from your lies
Breaking a part of my heart to find release ( Break )
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace ( Me )
Breaking a part of my heart to find release ( Too )
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace
Breaking a part of my heart to find release
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace
Breaking a part of my heart to find release
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace
Keep my distance
[ music slows to rap solo . ]
Spit drips from the jaw of the witless witness
Cryptic colloquialism shifts your midrift
Dark all I do embark the shadows
Involved with my thought catalog , analogue , rap catalog
Keep my distance , and fear resistance , hurt by persistance
The twisted web of tangled lies
Strangles my hope to waste and numbs the taste
And I 'm forced to face these hate crimes
Against the state of being
Feeling the weight-less-ness pressed between the ceiling
Reeling around room
Riding a bubble of sound proof
It 's the frequency making you
Sha-Shake with every boom
Involuntary muscle contraction
Ignoring and drinking musical gas field euphoria
The sound pounds to make the dead flush
To have you a head rush with red thoughts and said stuff
Animals ,
We 're all disposable , collapsable and raw ,
I suppose it 's just a state I 'm in ,
Animals who climb ,
Are climbing over you until you say
Off you go ,
Off you go
Animals ,
You are , looking for the answers just like me ,
And I go off and find a way ,
I make the most , make the most
Talking in my world ,
[ what 's this part ? mail me if you find out ! ]
But if you 're gonna go , go now ,
If you 're gonna go , go now ,
I forgot to tell you how ,
If you 're gonna go , go now ,
Animals ,
We 're all disposable , collapsable and raw ,
I suppose it 's just a state I 'm in ,
Oh Animal I am ,
I made all my excuses and I ,
I miss my chance like a storm , slow
But if you 're gonna go , go now ,
If you 're gonna go , go now ,
I forgot to tell you how ,
If you 're gonna go , go now ,
I 'm looking for the animal ,
I 'm searching for the animals , yeah
I 'm looking for the animal
Version II
Animal I am
disposable , collapsable and raw ,
in you go into some crowded room .
An animal that runs
around , away from you
and now I 'm scared ,
so off you go , off you go .
Animals you are
you 're searching for the future
just like me
and I don't know which way to turn .
An animal that climbs ,
I climb away from you
and then you say off you go , off you go .
Now if you 're gonna go , go now
Cos if you 're gonna go , go now
I forgot to tell you how
If you 're gonna go , go now .
Animal I am
disposable , collapsable and raw ,
I should know which way by now .
I 'm an animal that runs ,
I made all my excuses to you ,
and i missed my chance by a stones throw .
If you 're gonna go , go now
cos if you 're gonna go , go now
I forgot to tell you how
so if you 're gonna go , go now .
I 'm just alright
Class structure waving colors
Bleeding from my throat
Not subserviant to you I 'm just alright
Down classed by the powers that be
Give me loss of hope
Cast out . Buried in a hole
Struck down . forcing me to fall
Destroyed . giving up the fight
Well , I know I 'm not alright
What 's my price and will you pay it if it 's alright
Take it from my dignity
waste it until it 's dead
Throw me back into the gutter
' Cause it 's alright
Find another pleasure freaker
Drag them down to heck
Cast out . Buried in a hole
Struck down . forcing me to fall
Destroyed . giving up the fight
Well , I know I 'm not alright
Cast out . Buried in a hole
Struck down . forcing me to fall
Destroyed . giving up the fight
Well , I know I 'm not alright
need to remember just to breathe
Sometimes i
need you to STAY AWAY FROM ME
sometimes i 'm
in disbelief i didn't know
somehow i
need you to go
-Chorus-
Dont Stay
Forget our memories
Forget our possibilities
What you were changing me into
( Just give me myself back and )
Dont Stay
Forget our memories
forget our possibilities
take all your faithlessness with you
( just give me myself back and )
Dont Stay
Sometimes i
feel like i trusted you too well
sometimes i
just feel like SCREAMING AT MYSELF
sometimes im
in disbelief i didnt know
somehow i
need to be alone
-Chorus-
Dont Stay
Forget our memories
Forget our possibilities
What you were changing me into
( Just give me myself back and )
Dont Stay
Forget our memories
forget our possibilities
take all your faithlessness with you
( just give me myself back and )
Dont Stay
I dont need you
anymore
i dont want to be ignored
i dont need one
more day
of you wasting me away
i dont need you
anymore
i dont want to be ignored
i dont need one
more day
of you wasting me away .
( With no apologies )
-Chorus-
Dont Stay
Forget our memories
Forget our possibilities
What you were changing me into
( Just give me myself back and )
Dont Stay
Forget our memories
forget our possibilities
take all your faithlessness with you
( just give me myself back and )
Dont Stay
Dont stay
Dont Stay
How did I fall so far behind ?
Why Am I searching for perfection ?
Knowing it 's something I won't find
In my fear and flaws
I let myself down again
All because
[ Chorus ]
I run
Till the silence splits me open
I run
Till it puts me underground
Till I have no breath
And no roads left but one
When did I lose my sense of purpose ?
Can I regain what 's lost inside ?
Why do I feel like I deserve this ?
Why does my pain look like my pride ?
In my fear and flaws
I let myself down again
All because
I let myself down
In my fear and flaws
[ Chorus ]
I run
Till the silence splits me open
I run
Till it puts me underground
Till I have no breath
And no roads left but one
No roads left but one
In my fear and flaws
I let myself down again
All because
I run
And the silence splits me open
I run
And it puts me underground
But there 's no regret
And no roads left to run
And you never should have ,
You never should have ,
But don't break your back ,
If you ever see this ,
But don't answer that ,
In a bullet-proof vest ,
With the windows all closed ,
I 'll be doing my best ,
I 'll see you soon ,
In a telescope lens ,
And when all you want is friends ,
I 'll see you soon ,
So they came for you ,
They came snapping at your heels ,
They come snapping at your heels ,
But don't break your back ,
If you ever say this ,
But don't answer that ,
In a bullet-proof vest ,
With the windows all closed ,
I 'll be doing my best ,
I 'll see you soon ,
In a telescope lens ,
And when all you want is friends ,
I 'll see you soon ,
I know , you lost your trust ,
I know , don't lose your trust .
Hear the sound of the falling rain
Coming down like an Armageddon flame ( Hey ! )
The shame
The ones who died without a name
Hear the dogs howling out of key
To a hymn called " Faith and Misery " ( Hey ! )
And bleed , the company lost the war today
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
On holiday
Hear the drum pounding out of time
Another protestor has crossed the line ( Hey ! )
To find , the money 's on the other side
Can I get another Amen ? ( Amen ! )
There 's a flag wrapped around a score of men ( Hey ! )
A gag , a plastic bag on a monument
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
On holiday
( Hey ! )
( Say , Hey ! )
" The representative from California has the floor "
Zieg Heil to the president gasman
Bombs away is your punishment
Pulverize the Eiffel towers
Who criticize your government
Bang bang goes the broken glass and
Kill all the fags that don't agree
Trials by fire , setting fire
Is not a way that 's meant for me
Just cause , just cause , because we 're outlaws yeah !
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
This is our lives on holiday
And all my senses are coming unglued
Is there any cure for this disease someone called love
Not as long as there are girls like you
Everything she does questions my mental health
It makes me lose control
I just can't trust myself
If anyone can hear me slap some sense into me
But you turn your head and I end up talking to myself
Anxiety has got me strung out and frustrated
So I loose my head or I bang it up against the wall
Sometimes I wonder if I should be left alone
And lock myself up in a padded room
I 'd sit and spew my guts out to the open air
No one wants to hear a drunken fool
Everything she does questions my mental health
It makes me lose control
I just can't trust myself
If anyone can hear me slap some sense into me
But you turn your head and I end up talking to myself
Anxiety has got me strung out and frustrated
So I loose my head or I bang it up against the wall
I do not mind if this goes on
Cause now it seems I 'm too far gone
I must admit I enjoy myself
80 please keep taking me away
Everything she does questions my mental health
It makes me lose control
I just can't trust myself
If anyone can hear me slap some sense into me
But you turn your head and I end up talking to myself
Anxiety has got me strung out and frustrated
So I loose my head or I bang it up against the wall
This is my time of the year
This is my December
This is all so clear
This is my December
This is my snow covered home
This is my December
This is me alone
And I
Just wish that
I didn't feel
Like there was
Something I missed
And I
Take back all
The things I said
To make you
Feel like that
And I
Just wish that
I didn't feel
Like there was
Something I missed
And I
Take back all the
Things I said to you
And I give it all away
Just to have somewhere
To go to
Give it all away
To have someone
To come home to
This is my December
These are my snow covered dreams
This is me pretending
This is all I need
And I
Just wish that
I didn't feel
Like there was
Something I missed
And I
Take back all
The things I said
To make you feel like that
And I
Just wish that
I didn't feel
Like there was
Something I missed
And I
Take back all the things
I said to you
And I give it all away
Just to have
Somewhere to go to
Give it all away
To have someone
To come home to
This is my December
This is my time of the year
This is my December
This is all so clear
And I give it all away
Just to have somewhere
To go to
Give it all away
To have someone
To come home to
Tell me what do you see
But you quickly turn your head away
Try to find the words I could use
Don't have the courage to come up to you
My chance is looking a bit grey
Starting across the room
Are you leaving soon
I just need a little time
What is it that drives me mad
Girls like you that I never had
What is it about you that I adore
What makes me go so insane
That makes me feel so much pain
What is it about you that I adore
Starting across the room
Are you leaving soon
I just need a little time
Why did you have to leave so soon
Why did you have to walk away
Oh well it happened again
She walked away with her boyfriend
Maybe we 'll meet again someday .
And the places that I 've been
Pictures , faces , girls I 've loved
I try to remember when
Faded memories on the wall
Some names I have forgotten
But each one is a memory I
Look back on so often .
I look into the past
I want to make it last
I was there
I look into the past
I want to make it last
I was there
Looking back what I have done
There 's lots more life to live
At times I feel overwhelmed
I question what I can give
But I don't let it get me down
Or cause me too much sorrow
There 's no doubt about who I am
I always have tomorrow
I look into the past
I want to make it last
I was there
I look into the past
I want to make it last
I was there
Looking back upon my life
Faded memories on the wall
Looking now at who I am
I don't let it get me down .
Looking back upon my life
And the places that I 've been
Pictures , faces , girls I 've loved
I try to remember when
But I don't let it get me down
Or cause me too much sorrow
There 's no doubt about who I am
I always have tomorrow
I look into the past
I want to make it last
I was there
I look into the past
I want to make it last
I was there
Such a fuss to do nothing at all
Such a rush to do nothing at all
Such a rush to get nowhere at all
Such a fuss to do nothing at all
Such a rush .
And it 's just like you said ,
It 's just like you said .
Such a rush to do nothing at all .
Such a fuss to get nowhere at all .
Such a rush X2
And it 's just like you said .
It 's just like you said .
Just slow down please ,
Just slow down ,
Just slow down please ,
Just slow down .
Such a rush X15
Look at all the people going after money .
Far too many people looking for their money .
Everybody 's out there , trying to get money .
Why can't you just tell me ,
Try to get money , rush .
Such a rush .
They all rush .
Such a rush X7
In your lies
Do you tell yourself I don't realize
Your crusade 's a disguise
Replace freedom with fear
You trade money for lives
I 'm aware of what you 've done
[ Chorus ]
No no more sorrow
I 've paid for your mistakes
Your time is borrowed
Your time has come to be replaced
[ End Chorus ]
I see pain
I see need
I see liars and thieves
Abuse power with greed
I had hope
I believed
But I 'm beginning to think that I 've been deceived
You will pay for what you 've done
[ Chorus ]
No no more sorrow
I 've paid for your mistakes
Your time is borrowed
Your time has come to be replaced
[ End Chorus ]
Thieves and hypocrites
[ Chorus ]
No no more sorrow
I 've paid for your mistakes
Your time is borrowed
Your time has come to be replaced
No no more sorrow
I 've paid for your mistakes
Your time is borrowed
Your time has come to be replaced
Your time has come to be erased
[ End Chorus ]
Was letting go , not taking part
Was the hardest part
And the strangest thing
Was waiting for that bell to ring
It was the strangest start
I could feel it go down
Bittersweet , I could taste in my mouth
Silver lining the cloud
Oh and I
I wish that I could work it out
And the hardest part
Was letting go , not taking part
You really broke my heart
And I tried to sing
But I couldn't think of anything
And that was the hardest part
I could feel it go down
You left the sweetest taste in my mouth
You 're a silver lining the clouds
Oh and I
I wonder what it 's all about
Everything I know is wrong
Everything I do , it 's just comes undone
And everything is torn apart
Oh and it 's the part
That 's the hardest part
Yeah that 's the hardest part
That 's the hardest part
Such an endless dreary time
A time of hopes and happiness
That had you on my mind
Those days are gone and now it seems
As if I 'll get some rest
But now and then I 'll see you again
And it puts my heart to the test
So when are all my problems going to end
I 'm understanding now that
We are only friends
To this day I 'm asking why
I still think about you
As the days go on I wonder
( Will this ever end )
I find it hard to keep control
When you 're with your boyrfriend
I do not mind if all I am is
Just a friend to you
But all I want to know right now
Is if you think about me too .
So when are all my problems going to end
I 'm understanding now that
We are only friends
To this day I 'm asking why
I still think about you
So when are all my problems going to end
I 'm understanding now that
We are only friends
To this day I 'm asking why
I still think about you
and the pain attached to them
Sometimes I wonder why this is happenin '
It 's like nothing I could do would distract me when
I think of how I shot myself in the back again
' Cause from the infinite words I could say I
Put all the pain you gave to me on display
But didn't realize
Instead of setting it free I
took what I hated and made it apart of me
[ It Never Goes Away . ] x2
And now
You 've become a part of me
You 'll always be right here
You 've become a part of me
You 'll always be my fear
I can't separate
Myself from what I 've done
Giving up a part of me
I 've let myself become you
You .
Hearing your name
the memories come back again
I remember when it started happenin '
I 'd see you in every thought I had
and then
my thoughts slowly found words attached to them .
And I knew as they escaped away I was
committing myself to ' em
And every day
I regret saying those things
cause now I see
that I
took what I hated and made it apart of me .
[ It Never Goes Away ] x2
And now
You 've become a part of me
You 'll always be right here
You 've become a part of me
You 'll always be my fear
I can't separate
Myself from what I 've done
Giving up a part of me
I 've let myself become you
[ It Never Goes Away ] x4
( get away from ME ! )
Give me my space back
You 've gotta just
( GO ! )
Everything just comes down to memories of
( YOU ! )
I 've kept it in but now I 'm letting you
( KNOW ! )
I 've let you go !
So
( get away from ME ! )
Give me my space back
You 've gotta just
( GO ! )
Everything just comes down to memories of
( YOU ! )
I 've kept it in but now I 'm letting you
( KNOW ! )
I 've let you go !
And now
You 've become a part of me
You 'll always be right here
You 've become a part of me
You 'll always be my fear
I can't separate
Myself from what I 've done
Giving up a part of me
I 've let myself become you
I 've let myself become lost inside these thoughts of you
Giving up a part of me
I 've let myself become you
Love to the lovely song
And it goes on
You don't have to be alone
Your heavy heart
Is made of stone
And it 's so hard to see you clearly
You don't have to be on your own
And I 'm not gonna take it back
And I 'm not gonna say I don't mean that
You 're the target that I 'm aiming at
Take my message home
My song is love
My song is love , unknown
But I 'm on fire for you , clearly
You don't have to be alone
You don't have to be on your own
And I 'm not gonna take it back
Oh I 'm not gonna say I don't mean that
You 're the target that I 'm aiming at
And I 'm nothing on my own
Got to get that message home
And I 'm not gonna stand and wait
Not gonna be there until it 's much too late
On a platform I 'm gonna stand and say
That I 'm nothing on my own
And I love you , please come home
My song is love , is love unknown
And I 've got to get that message home
Gra
Grafitti sky
I don't think you 're all ready
Yo , I don't think you 're all ready
Grafitti decourations
Under a sky of grey
This constant apprehension
Still giving me away
The lessons I 've forgotten
In spite of all I 've learned
Now , I find myself in question
Point the finger at me again
Guilty by association
Point the finger at me again
I want to runaway ( I want to runaway )
I want to know the truth ( I want to know the truth )
I want to know the answers ( I want to know the answers )
I want to shut the door
And open up my mind
Paperbags and angry voices
Under a sky of grey
This constant apprehension
Won't seem to go away
All my talk of starting over
These words were never true
Now , I find myself in question
Point the finger at me again
Guilty by association
Point the finger at me again
I want to run away ( I want to runaway )
I want to know the truth ( I want to know the truth )
I want to know the answers ( I want to know the answers )
I want to shut the door
And open up my mind
Going to runaway
Going to runaway ( way )
Going to runaway
Going to runaway ( way , way )
Going to runaway
Hey , y'all not ready
Hey , yo
I don't think y'all ready for what I 'm about to do
All you new-skool dudes ain't even got no clue
How dare you forget about Bam and Zue Lue
Cool Herc and Jazzy J .
They paved the way
Let me spit it for y'all who said I wasn't going to make it
Every time I blaze it , y'all the first to hate it
My team reigns supreme to stay strong
Got the true series , son
They scared to put us on
Can't get with hybrids
Get off your hiatus
To many all 's dying for it
So , I got to blaze it
Still ripping BK , Brooklyn , B and on
Hell-fighting family , aliennation
Banging hits in the backyard while LP 's on
I 'm a little communicate
Phoenix Orion
I want to runaway ( I want to runaway )
I want to know the truth ( I want to know the truth )
I want to know the answers ( I want to know the answers )
I want to shut the door
And open up my mind
Well , people try to put us down
Talkin ' bout my generation
Just because we get around
Talkin ' bout my generation
The things they do look awful cold
Talkin ' bout my generation
I hope I die before I get old
Talkin ' bout my generation
My generation
Why don't you all just fade away
Talkin ' bout my generation
And don't try to dig what we all say
Talkin ' bout my generation
I 'm not trying to cause a big sensation
Talkin ' bout my generation
I 'm just talkin ' bout my generation
Talkin ' bout my generation
My generation .
Break it , freak that shoot !
Why don't you all just fade away
Talkin ' bout my generation
And don't try to dig what we all say
Talkin ' bout my generation
I 'm not trying to cause a big sensation
Talkin ' bout my generation
I 'm just talkin ' bout my generation
Talkin ' bout my generation
My generation
Talkin ' bout my generation
This is my generation
This is my generation , baby
You were so scared
But no one would listen
Cause no one else cared
After my dreaming
I woke with this fear
What am I leaving
When I 'm done here
So if you 're asking me
I want you to know
[ Chorus ]
When my time comes
Forget the wrong that I 've done
Help me leave behind some
Reasons to be missed
And don't resent me
And when you 're feeling empty
Keep me in your memory
Leave out all the rest
[ End Chorus ]
Don't be afraid
I 've taking my beating
I 've shared what I made
I 'm strong on the surface
Not all the way through
I 've never been perfect
But neither have you
So if you 're asking me
I want you to know
[ Chorus ]
When my time comes
Forget the wrong that I 've done
Help me leave behind some
Reasons to be missed
Don't resent me
And when you 're feeling empty
Keep me in your memory
Leave out all the rest
[ End Chorus ]
Forgetting
All the hurt inside
You 've learned to hide so well
Pretending
Someone else can come and save me from myself
I can't be who you are
[ Chorus ]
When my time comes
Forget the wrong that I 've done
Help me leave behind some
Reasons to be missed
Don't resent me
And when you 're feeling empty
Keep me in your memory
Leave out all the rest
Forgetting
All the hurt inside
You 've learned to hide so well
Pretending
Someone else can come and save me from myself
I can't be who you are
Think of my future now
I just don't know
I don't seem to care
I stop to notice that
I 'm by your home
I wonder if you 're sitting all alone
Or is your boyfriend there
Because I feel so right
Let my imagination go
Until you 're in my sight
And through my veins temptation flows
Whoa hoa .
Out here .
So I sit down here on the hard concrete
Think of my future now
I just don't know
I don't seem to care
So I sit across the street from your home
I wonder if you 're sitting all alone
Or is your boyfriend there
Because I feel so right
Let my imagination go
Until you 're in my sight
And through my veins temptation flows
Whoa hoa .
Out here .
Because I feel so right
Let my imagination go
Until you 're in my sight
And through my veins temptation flows
Whoa hoa .
Out here .
I missed the good part , then I realised
I started looking and the bubble burst
I started looking for excuses
Come on in
I 've gotta tell you what a state I 'm in
I 've gotta tell you in my loudest tones
That I started looking for a warning sign
When the truth is , I miss you
Yeah the truth is , that I miss you so
A warning sign
It came back to haunt me , and I realised
That you were an island and I passed you by
And you were an island to discover
Come on in
I 've gotta tell you what a state I 'm in
I 've gotta tell you in my loudest tones
That I started looking for a warning sign
When the truth is , I miss you
Yeah the truth is , that I miss you so
And I 'm tired , I should not have let you go
Oooooooo
So I crawl back into your open arms
Yes I crawl back into your open arms
And I crawl back into your open arms
Yes I crawl back into your open arms .
All dressed up and bound and gagged
To a chair
It 's so unfair
I won't dare move , for the pain
She puts me through is what I need
So make it bleed
I 'm in distress , oh mistress
I confess so do it one more time
These handcuffs are too tight
You know I will obey , so please
Don't make me beg
For blood , sex and booze you give me
Some say I 'm disturbed
But it 's what I deserve , another lesson
To be learned . from a girl called kill
My head is in the gutter
Thank you sir , strike up another mandolin
Of discipline
Throw me to the dogs
Let them eat my flesh down
To the wood
It feels so good
Everyone must find a place
Give me time and give me space
Give me real , don't give me fake
Give me strength , reserve control
Give me heart and give me soul
Give me time , give us a kiss
Tell me your own politik
Open up your eyes
Just open up your eyes
Give me one , cause one is best
In confusion , confidence
Give me piece of mind and trust
Don't forget the rest of us
Give me strength , reserve control
Give me heart and give me soul
Wounds that heal and cracks that fix
Tell me your own politik
Open up your eyes
Just open up your eyes
And give me love over , love over , love over this , ahhh
A thrill seeker making deals
Sugar city urchin wasting time
Town of lunatics
Begging for another fix
Turning tricks for speedballs
One more night
Making your rounds once again
Turning up empty handed
Bumming a ride
Burning daylight
Last up at dawn . tight wad hill
Drugstore hooligan
Another white trash mannequin
On display to rot up on the hill
Living out a lie
But having the time of his life
Hating every minute of his existance
Making your rounds once again
Turning up empty handed
Bumming a ride
Burning daylight
Last up at dawn . tight wad hill
Making your rounds once again
Turning up empty handed
Bumming a ride
Burning daylight
Last up at dawn . tight wad hill
Watching the cars go rolling by
My friends are gone
I 've got nothing to do
So I sit here patiently
Watching the clock tick so slowly
Gotta get away
Or my brains will explode
Give me something to do to kill some time
Take me to that place that I call home
Take away the strains of being lonely
Take me to the tracks at Christie Road
See the hills from afar
Standing on my beat up car
The sun went down and the night fills the sky
Now I feel like me once again
As the train comes rolling in
Smoked my boredom gone
Slapped my brains up so high
Give me something to do to kill some time
Take me to that place that I call home
Take away the strains of being lonely
Take me to the tracks at Christie Road
Mother stay out of my way of that place we go
We 'll always seem to find our way to Christie Road
Mother stay out of my way of that place we go
We 'll always seem to find our way to Christie Road
If there 's one thing that I need
That makes me feel complete
So I go to Christie Road
It 's home .
I hope we can find a way
Seeing it all
Love , I hope we can be
I hope I can find a way
Of letting you see
That I 'm so easy to please
So easy
Love , I hope we grow up
I hope we can find a way
Of seeing it all
Love , I hope we can be
I hope I can find a way
Of letting you see
That I 'm so easy to please
So easy
I want to be in another place
I hate when you say you don't understand
I want to be in the energy
Not with the enemy
A place for my head
I watch how the moon sits in the sky on a dark night
Shining with the light from the sun
But the sun doesn't give the light to the moon assuming the moon 's going to owe it one
It makes me think of how you act to me
You do favours then rapidly
You just turn around and start asking me about things that you want back from me
I 'm so sick of the tension
Sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest
I 'm so sick of the tension
Sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest
I want to be in another place
I hate when you say you don't understand
You 'll see it 's not meant to be
I want to be in the energy
Not with the enemy
A place for my head
I want to be in another place
I hate when you say you don't understand
You 'll see it 's not meant to be
I want to be in the energy
Not with the enemy
A place for my head
Two , two , three , three
Yo , yo , yo
Give me Energon to keep me calm
You and your mom keep all the dram
Used to be a team , passed that baton
But you flop that bomb as you drop that bomb
Take it to the john in your babylon
Flushed down with the sound that you carry on
I don't really give a dang
You p*d on my lawn
Took a dump like a punk
Now the battle 's on
So sick of you stressing
Sick of you fessing
Sick of you acting like I owe you some
Find another place
To feed your face
If you don't , we gon ' bump
Get it up here , crunk
So sick of you stressing
Sick of you fessing

You try to take the best of me
You try to take the best of me , go away
You try to take the best of me
You try to take the best of me , go away
You try to take the best of me
You try to take the best
Go , go away
You try to take the best of me , go away
You try to take the best of me ( get away from me ) , go away
You try to take the best of me , go away
Get away from me
a manner of matter that splits with the words I breathe
and as the rain drips acidic questions around me
i block out the sight of the powers that be
duck away into the darkness , times up
i wind up in a rusted world with eyes shut
so tight that it blurs into the world of pretend
and the eyes ease open and it 's dark again
from the top to the bottom
bottom to top I stop
at the core , I 'm forgotten
in the middle of my thoughts
taken far from my safety
the picture 's there
the memory won't escape me
by why should I care
in the memory you 'll find me
eyes burning up
the darkness holding me tightly
until the sun rises up .
listen to the sound , dizzy from the ups and downs
and nauseated by the polluted rock that 's all around
watchin the wheels of cars that pass I look past
to the last of the light and the long shadows it casts
a window grows and captures the eye
and cries out yellow light as it passes me by
and a young shadowy figure sits in front of a box
inside a building of rocks with antennas on top
now , nothing can stop in this land of the pain
the same lose , not knowing they were part of the game
and while the insides change , the box stays the same
and the figure inside could bear anybody 's name
the memories I keep are from a time like then
I put on my paper so I could come back to them
someday I 'm hopin to close my eyes and pretend
that this crumpled up paper can be perfect again
from the top to the bottom
bottom to top I stop
at the core , I 'm forgotten
in the middle of my thoughts
taken far from my safety
the picture 's there
the memory won't escape me
I 'm here at the podium talking , the ceremonial offerings
dedicated to urban dysfunctional to offspring
what 's happening ? city governments are eternally napping
trapped in greedy covenants , causin urban collapsing
bullets that scar souls , with dark holds , get more than your car stole
some hearts be blacker than charcoal
for real , this society 's deprivation depends
not on outer differences , but the separation within
no preparation is made , limited age , and minimum wage
livin in a tenement cage for innocent pay
tragedy within a parade ,
the darkness overspread like permanent plague ,
I 'm forgotten
in the memory you 'll find me
eyes burning up
the darkness holding me tightly
until the sun rises up .
the night of the living dead is on its way
with a credit report for duty call
it 's a lifetime guarantee
stuffed in a coffin 10% more free
Red light special at the mausoleum
Give me something that I need
satisfaction guaranteed to you
what 's the consolation prize
economy sized dreams of hope
when I was a kid I thought
I wanted all the things that I haven't got
oh . I learned the hardest way
Then I realized what it took
To tell the difference between
thieves and crooks
A lesson learned to me and you
Give me something that I need
Satisfaction guaranteed
Because I 'm thinking about
a brand new hope
the one I 've never known
cause now I know
it 's all that I wanted
what 's the consolation prize
economy sized dreams of hope
Give me something that I need
Satisfaction guaranteed
Because I 'm thinking about
a brand new hope
the one I 've never known
and where it goes
and I 'm thinking about
the only road
the one I 've never known
and where it goes
Because I 'm thinking about
a brand new hope
the one I 've never known
cause now I know
it 's all that I wanted
A whisper [ x4 ]
I hear the sound of a ticking of clocks
Remember your face , and remember see where you are gone
I hear the sound of the ticking of clocks
Come back and look for me , look for me when I am lost
Just a whisper , whisper , whisper , whisper [ x2 ]
Night turns to day and I still have these questions
You just won't break , should I go forwards or backwards
Night turns to day and I 've still got no answers
Just a whisper , whisper , whisper , whisper [ x2 ]
Now I hear the sound of a ticking of clocks
Remember your face , and remember see where you are gone
I hear the sound of the ticking of clocks
Come back and look for me , look for me when I am lost
Just a whisper , whisper , whisper , whisper [ x2 ]
From the rooftops I remember
There was snow
White snow
Clearly I remember
From the windows they were watching
While we froze down below
When the future 's architectured
By a carnival of idiots on show
You 'd better lie low
If you love me
Won't you let me know ?
Was a long and dark December
When the banks became cathedrals
And the fog
Became God
Priests clutched onto bibles
Hollowed out to fit their rifles
And the cross was held aloft
Bury me in honor
When I 'm dead and hit the ground
A love back home it unfolds
If you love me
Won't you let me know ?
I don't want to be a soldier
With a captain of some sinking ship
With snow
Far below
So if you love me
Why 'd you let me go ?
I took my love down to violet hill
There we sat in the snow
All that time
She was silent still
So if you love me
Won't you let me know ?
If you love me
Won't you let me know ?
To do you wrong ,
That 's what I came here to say .
But if I was wrong ,
Then I 'm sorry ,
I don't let it stand in our way .
As my head just aches ,
When I think of ,
The things that I shouldn't have done .
But , life is for living ,
We all know ,
And I don't wanna live it alone .
Sing ,
Ah , ah , oh ,
Sing ,
Ah , ah , oh ,
And just think ,
Ah , ah , oh .
Back up against the wall
What goes around is coming back and haunting you
It 's time to quit
Cause you ain't worth the shit
Under my shoes or the piss on the ground
No one loves you and you know it
Don't pretend that you enjoy it or you don't care
Cause now I wouldn't lie or tell you all the things you want
to hear .
I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU
I heard your sick
Sucked on that cancer stick
A throbbing tumor and a radiation high
Shit out of luck
And now your time is up
It brings me pleasure just to know you 're going to die
Dickhead , Fuckface , cock smoking , mother fucking , asshole ,
dirty twat , waste of semen , I hope you die HEY
Red eye , code blue
I 'd like to strangle you
And watch your eyes bulge right out of your skull
When you go down
Head first into the ground
I 'll stand above you just to piss on your grave
Skyscrapers and stargazers in my head
Are we we are , are we we are the waiting unknown
This dirty town was burning down in my dreams
Lost and found city bound in my dreams
And screaming
Are we we are , are we we are the waiting
And screaming
Are we we are , are we we are the waiting
Forget me nots and second thoughts live in isolation
Heads or tails and fairytales in my mind
Are we we are , are we we are the waiting unknown
The rage and love , the story of my life
The Jesus of suburbia is a lie
And screaming
Are we we are , are we we are the waiting
And screaming
Are we we are , are we we are the waiting unknown
Are we we are , are we we are the waiting
And screaming
Are we we are , are we we are the waiting unknown
Oh way over on the rooftops let 's get married .
All summer we just hurried
so come over , just be patient , and don't worry .
So come over , just be patient , and don't worry .
And don't worry .
No I don't wanna battle from beginning to end ;
I don't wanna cycle , recycle revenge ;
I don't wanna follow death and all his friends .
No I don't wanna battle from beginning to end ;
I don't wanna cycle , recycle revenge ;
I don't wanna follow death and all of his friends .
Way down Louisiana close to New Orleans ,
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens .
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood ,
Where lived a country boy name of Johnny B . Goode .
He never ever learned to read or write so well ,
But he could play the guitar like ringing a bell .
Go Go
Go Johnny Go
Go Go
Johny be good
He use to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
And sit beneath the trees by the railroad track .
Oh , the engineers used to see him sitting in the shade ,
Playing to the rhythm that the drivers made .
People passing by would stop and say
Oh my that little country boy could play
Go Go
Go Johnny Go
Go Go
Johny be good
His mama told him someday he would be a man ,
And he would be the leader of a big old band .
Many people coming from miles around
To hear him play his music when the sun go down
Maybe someday his name would be in lights
Saying Johnny B . Goode tonight .
I 'd like to introduce .
Mr. Hahn !
Let 's hear it for the great Mr. Hahn !
And now a lesson in rhythm management .
Let 's begin .
Alright now , wasn't that fun ?
Let 's try something else .
But in time I realized I was wrong
My immortal thoughts turned into just dreams of a dead future
It was a tragic case of my reality
Do you think you 're indestructable
And no one can touch you
Well I think you 're disposeable
And it 's time you knew the truth .
Cause it 's just one of my lies !
Well , its just its just one of my lies
And all I wanted to was get real high
Well , its just its just one of my lies
Why does my life have to be so small
Yet death is forever
And does forever have a life to call its own
Don't give me an answer cause you
Only know as much as I know
Unless you 're been there once
Well I hardly think so
Do you think you 're indestructable
And no one can touch you
Well I think you 're disposeable
And it 's time you knew the truth .
Cause it 's just one of my lies !
Well , its just its just one of my lies
And all I wanted to was get real high
Well , its just its just one of my lies
I used to pray all night
Before I lay myself down
My mother said it was right
Her mother said it too .
Why
crawling in my skin
these wounds they will not heal
fear is how i fall
confusing what is real
there 's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
consuming/confusing
this lack of self-control i fear is never ending
controlling/i can't seem
[ bridge :]
to find myself again
my walls are closing in
( without a sense of confidence and i 'm convinced that there 's just too much pressure to take )
i 've felt this way before
so insecure
[ chorus ]
discomfort , endlessly has pulled itself upon me
distracting/reacting
against my will i stand beside my own reflection
it 's haunting how i can't seem .
[ bridge ]
[ chorus ]
We lie awake
And we dream
We 'll make an escape
And in the end
We lie awake
And we dream
We 'll make an escape
Ooh .
Broken bones and nasty cuts
ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN
But this time I can't get up
She comes to check on me
MAKING sure I 'm on my knees
After all she 's the one
Who put me in this STATE
Is she ULTRA-VIOLENT
Is she DISTURBED
I better tell her that I LOVE her
Before she does it all over again
OH GOD , SHE 'S KILLING ME !
For now I 'll lie around
heck , that 's all I can really do
She takes good care of me
Just keep saying my LOVE is TRUE
Is she ULTRA-VIOLENT
Is she DISTURBED
I better tell her that I LOVE her
Before she does it all over again
OH GOD , SHE 'S KILLING ME !
Looking out my window for
Someone that 's passing by
No one knows I 'm LOCKED in here
All I do is cry
For now I 'll lie around
heck , that 's all I can really do
She takes good care of me
Just keep saying my LOVE is TRUE
Mentally moonwalk
Mixed media slang
Banging in your boom box verbal violence
Lyrical stylist
In a time when rock hip hop rhymes are childish
You can't tempt me with rhymes that are empty
Rapping to a beat doesn't make you an emcee
With your lack of skill and facility
You 're killing me
And a DJ in the group just for credibility
I heard that some of you are getting help with your rhymes
You 're not an emcee if someone else writes your lines
And rapping over rock doesn't make you a pioneer
Cause rock and hip hop have collaborated for years
But now they 're getting randomly mixed and matched up
All after a fast buck and all the tracks suck
So how does it stack up None of it 's real
You want to be an emcee you 've got to study the skill
Who can rock a rhyme like this
Bring it to you every time like this [ 2x ]
Step , step up , step , step up
So you pick up a pen and write yourself a new identity
But mentally you don't have the hip hop energy
With a tendency to make up stories
Sounding like the only hip hop you 've heard is top 40
And your record company is completely missing it
All the kids are dissing it for not being legitimate
So in a battle you can't hack it
React with whack shit
And get smacked with verbal back flips
Get your ass kicked by fabulous battle catalysts
It 's taken decades for emcees to establish this
You 're new to hip hop and welcome if your serious
But not on the mic
Leave that to the experienced
( Using the waves of sound the true master paralyzes his opponents , leaving him
vulnerable to attack )
[ Chorus ( 2x )]
( After years of pain staking research by the world 's leading sound scientists , we
here at the sound institute have invented a reliable audio weapons system . Actual
movement of musical sound in space used to carefully attack and neutralize the
cellular structure of the human body , and the question must be asked . )
[ Chorus ( 2x )]
The same way that I always do
This is the last smile
That I 'll fake for the sake of being with you
( Everything falls apart
Even the people who never frown
Eventually break down )
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
( Everything has to end
You 'll soon find we 're out of time left
To watch it all unwind )
The sacrifice is never knowing
Why I never walked away
Why I played myself this way
Now I see your testing me pushes me away
Why I never walked away
Why I played myself this way
Now I see your testing me pushes me away
I 've tried like you
To do everything you wanted too
This is the last time
I 'll take the blame for the sake of being with you
( Everything falls apart
Even the people who never frown
Eventually break down )
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
( Everything has to end
You 'll soon find we 're out of time left
To watch it all unwind )
The sacrifice is never knowing
Why I never walked away
Why I played myself this way
Now I see your testing me pushes me away
Why I never walked away
Why I played myself this way
Now I see your testing me pushes me away
( We 're all out of time
This is how we find how it all unwinds )
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
( We 're all out of time
This is how we find how it all unwinds )
The sacrifice is never knowing
Why I never walked away
Why I played myself this way
Now I see your testing me pushes me away
Why I never walked away
Why I played myself this way
Now I see your testing me pushes me away
Pushes me away
Moon sits in the sky / in the dark night
Shining with the light from the sun
The sun doesn't give / light to the moon assuming
The moon 's going to owe it one
It makes me think of how you act to me / You do
Favors and then rapidly / You just
Turn around and start asking me / about
Things you want back from me
I 'm sick of the tension / sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place / to feed your greed -
While I find a place to rest
I want to be in another place
I hate when you say you don't understand
( You 'll see it 's not meant to be )
I want to be in the energy , not with the enemy
A place for my head
Maybe someday I 'll be just like you / and
Step on people like you do and / Run
Away the people I thought I knew
I remember back then who you were
You used to be calm / used to be strong
Used to be generous / but you should 've known / That you 'd
Wear out your welcome / now you see
How quiet it is / all alone / I 'm so
Sick of the tension / sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place / to feed your greed -
While / I find a place to rest / I 'm so
Sick of the tension / sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place / to feed your greed -
While / I find a place to rest
You try to take the best of me

I 've been taking into crates ever since I was livin in space
Before the ratrace , before monkeys had human traits
Mastered numerology and bigbang theology
Performed lobotomies with telekinetic psychology
Invented the mic so I could start blessin it
And chincheckin kids to make my point like an impressionist
Many men have tried to shake us
But I twist mic cords to double helixes and show them what I 'm made of
I buckle knees like leg braces
Cast the spell of instrumental-ness and all of the emcees that hate us
So try on , leave you without a shoulder to cry on
From now to infinity let icons be bygones
I fire bomb ghostly notes haunt this
I 've tried threats but moved on to a promise
I stomp shit with or without an accomplis

They were sitting on the strawberry swing
Every moment was so precious
They were sitting
They were talking under strawberry swing
Everybody was for fighting
Wouldn't wanna waste a thing
Cold , cold water bring me round
Now my feet won't touch the ground
Cold , cold water what ya say ?
When it 's such
It 's such a perfect day
I remember
We were walking up to strawberry swing
I can't wait until the morning
Wouldn't wanna change a thing
People moving all the time
Inside a perfectly straight line
Don't you wanna curve away ?
When it 's such
It 's such a perfect day
Now the sky could be blue
I don't mind
Without you it 's a waste of time
Could be blue
I don't mind
Without you it 's a waste of time
Could be blue ,
Could be grey
Without you I 'm just miles away
Could be blue
I don't mind
Without you it 's a waste of time
One life for yourself and one for your dreams
You drift through the years and life seems tame
Till one dream appears and love is its name
And love is a stranger who 'll beckon you on
Don't think of the danger or the stranger is gone
This dream is for you , so pay the price
Make one dream come true , you only live twice
And love is a stranger who 'll beckon you on
Don't think of the danger or the stranger is gone
This dream is for you , so pay the price
Make one dream come true , you only live twice
Staring at the mirror
I couldn't find a reason why
I couldn't be near her
' Cause you are the one that started
To make me feel this way
And every night I 'm thinking
About the words you 'd say
Pictures going through my mind
When we 're together
All these long and sleepless nights
Will I ever get better
' Cause you are the one that started
To make me feel this way
And every night I 'm thinking
About the words you 'd say
' Cause you are THE ONE THAT I WANT
Now you know how I feel
This love is forever
You make my life seem so unreal
Will I ever get better .
' Cause you are the one that started
To make me feel this way
And every night I 'm thinking
About the words you 'd say
' Cause you are THE ONE THAT I WANT
This is my time of the year
This is my December
This is all so clear
This is my December
This is my snow covered home
This is my December
This is me alone
( And I )
Just wish that I didn't feel like there was something I missed
( And I )
Take back all the things I said to make you feel like that
( And I )
Just wish that I didn't feel like there was something I missed
( And I )
Take back all the things that I said to you
And I 'd give it all away
Just to have somewhere to go to
Give it all away
To have someone to come home to
This is my December
These are my snow covered trees
This is me pretending
This is all I need
( And I )
Just wish that I didn't feel like there was something I missed
( And I )
Take back all the things I said to make you feel like that
( And I )
Just wish that I didn't feel like there was something I missed
( And I )
Take back all the things that I said to you
And I 'd give it all away
Just to have somewhere to go to
Give it all away
To have someone to come home to
This is my December
This is my time of the year
This is my December
This is all so clear
Give it all away
Just to have somewhere to go to
Give it all away
To have someone to come home to
Give it all away
Give it all away
But hands beg me to stay
Your lips say that you love
Your eyes say that you hate
There 's truth in your lies
Doubt in your faith
What you build you lay to waste
This truth in your lies
Doubt in your faith
All I 've got 's what you didn't take
[ Chorus ]
So I , I won't be the one
Be the one to leave this
In pieces
And you
You will be alone
Alone with all your secrets
And regrets
Don't lie
[ End Chorus ]
You promise me the sky
Then toss me like a stone
You wrap me in your arms
And chill me to the bone
This truth in your lies
Doubt in your faith
All I 've got 's what you didn't take
[ Chorus ]
So I , I won't be the one
Be the one to leave this
In pieces
And you
You will be alone
Alone with all your secrets
And regrets
Don't lie
So I , I won't be the one
Be the one to leave this
In pieces
And you
You will be alone
Alone with all your secrets
And regrets
Don't lie
[ End Chorus ]
Another day 's been laid to waste
In my disgrace
Stuck in my head again
Feels like I 'll never leave this place
There 's no escape
I 'm my own worst enemy
[ chorus ]
I 've given up
I 'm sick of living
Is there nothing you can say
Take this all away
I 'm suffocating
Tell me what the fuck is wrong
With me
[ end chorus ]
I don't know what to take
Thought I was focused but I 'm scared
I 'm not prepared
I hyperventilate
Looking for help somehow somewhere
And you don't care
I 'm my own worst enemy
[ chorus ]
I 've given up
I 'm sick of living
Is there nothing you can say
Take this all away
I 'm suffocating
Tell me what the fuck is wrong
With me
[ end chorus ]
[ bridge ]
Goddddddd !
Put me out of my misery
Put me out of my
Put me out of my fucking misery
[ end bridge ]
[ chorus ]
I 've given up
I 'm sick of living
Is there nothing you can say
Take this all away
I 'm suffocating
Tell me what the fuck is wrong
With me
[ end chorus ]
all the way across town
You 've been searching for that someone ,
and it 's me out on the prowl
As you sit around feeling sorry for yourself
Don't get lonely now
Dry your whining eyes
I 'm just roaming for the moment
Sleazin ' my back yard so don't get so uptight
you been thinking about ditching me
No time to search the world around
Cause you know where I 'll be found
When I come around
I heard it all before
So don't knock down my door
I 'm a loser and a user so I don't need no accuser
to try and slag me down because I know I 'm right
So go do what you like
Make sure you do it wise
You may find out that your selfdoubt means nothing
was ever there
You can't go forcing something if it 's just
not right
No time to search the world around
Cause you know where I 'll be found
When I come around
Only this time I think I stuck my foot in my mouth .
Thinking out loud and acting in vain .
Knocking over anyone that stands in my way .
Sometimes I need to apologize .
Sometimes I need to admit that I ain't right .
Sometimes I should just keep my mouth shut , or only say hecko .
Sometimes I still feel I 'm walking alone .
Walk on eggshecks on my old stomping ground ,
yet there 's really no one left , that 's hanging around .
Isn't that another familiar face
Too drunk to figure out they 're fading away .
And what 's my master plan .
What makes you think that it includes you
Self-righteous wealth
Stop flattering yourself , ' cause when the smoke clears here I am .
Your reject all-American .
Sucking up you social sect , making you a nervous wreck .
To heck and back and heck again I 've gone .
You 're not my type .
Not my type .
What 's the difference between you and me
I do what I want , and you do what you 're told .
So listen up and shut the heck up .
It ain't no big deal .
And I 'll see you in heck , ' cause when the smoke clears here I am ,
your reject all-American .
Falling from grace , right on my fave .
To heck and back and heck again I 've gone .
I 've paid my dues
Time after time
I 've done my sentence
But committed no crime
And bad mistakes
I 've made a few
I 've had my share of sand kicked in my face
But I 've come through
We are the champions - my friends
And we 'll keep on fighting - till the end -
We are the champions -
We are the champions
No time for losers
' Cause we are the champions - of the world -
I 've taken my bows
And my curtain calls -
You brought me fame and fortuen and everything that goes with it
- and some fucking great cheers
I thank you all -
But it 's been no bed of roses
No pleasure cruise
I consider it a challenge before the whole human race
And I ain't gonna lose
We are the champions - my friends
And we 'll keep on fighting - till the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
' Cause we are the champions - of the world
And I need some kind of output .
For input twice the size of my one inch mind .
So slap me on the hand .
Put it right back down my pants .
Turn me right around .
Kick me in the ass .
Well today I say sweet things ,
But tomorrow ,
I 'll be making up excuses ,
For my actions ' cuz it 's been so long ,
Since I 've been in love .
That special kind of feeling .
Guess my best excuse .
I 'm on the wagon again .
Well today I say sweet things ,
But tomorrow ,
I 'll be making up excuses ,
For my actions ' cuz it 's been so long ,
Since I 've been in love .
That special kind of feeling .
Guess my best excuse .
I 'm on the wagon again .
Well I got no real excuse .
I 'm on the wagon again .
OH YEAH !
Where 's my fuckin frappuccino
Alright , let 's do this
When I pretend everything is what I want it to be
I look exactly like what you always wanted to see
When I pretend , I can't forget about the criminal I am
Stealing second after second just cause I know I can but
I can't pretend this is the way it 'll stay I 'm just
Trying to bend the truth
I can't pretend I 'm who you want me to be , so I 'm
Lying my way from
If you feelin like a pimp nigga , go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too , go and brush your shoulders off
Niggaz is crazy baby , don't forget that boy told you
Get , that , dirt off your shoulder
I probably owe it to y'all , proud to be locked by the force
Tryin to hustle some things , that go with the Porsche
Feelin no remorse , feelin like my hand was forced
Middle finger to the law , nigga grip'n my balls
All the ladies they love me , from the bleachers they screamin
All the ballers is bouncin they like the way I be leanin
All the rappers be hatin , off the track that I 'm makin
But all the hustlers they love it just to see one of us make it
Came from the bottom the bottom , to the top of the pots
Nigga London , Japan and I 'm straight off the block
Like a running back , get it man , I 'm straight off the block
I can run it back nigga cause I 'm straight with the Roc
If you feelin like a pimp nigga , go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too , go and brush your shoulders off
Niggaz is crazy baby , don't forget that boy told you
Get , that , dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get ( get ) , that(that ) , dirt off your shoulder
Your homey Hov ' in position , in the kitchen with soda
I just whipped up a watch , tryin to get me a Rover
Tryin to stretch out the coca , like a wrestler , yessir
Keep the Heckler close , you know them smokers 'll test ya
But like , fifty-two cards when I 'm , I 'm through dealin
Now fifty-two bars come out , now you feel ' em
Now , fifty-two cars roll out , remove ceiling
In case fifty-two broads come out , now you chillin
with a boss bitch of course S.C. on the sleeve
At the 40/40 club , ESPN on the screen
I paid a grip for the jeans , plus the slippers is clean
No chrome on the wheels , I 'm a grown-up for real , chill
Yeah , I remember what they taught to me
Remember condescending talk of who I ought to be
Remember listening to all of that and this again
So I pretended up a person who was fittin ' in
And now you think this person really is me and I 'm
Trying to bend the truth
But the more I push the more I 'm pulling away ' cuz I 'm
Lying my way from you
No no turning back now
I wanna be pushed aside so let me go
No no turning back now
Let me take back my life I 'd rather be all alone
No turning back now
Anywhere on my own cuz I can see
No no turning back now
The very worst part of you
The very worst part of you is ME
This isn't what I wanted to be , I never thought that what I said would
have you running from me
Like This
This isn't what I wanted to be , I never thought that what I said would
have you running from me
Like This

Let me take back my life I 'd rather be all alone
No turning back now
Anywhere on my own cuz I can see
No no turning back now
The very worst part of you
The very worst part of you is me
Beeitch
I 'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
' Cause I 'm one step closer to the edge
And I 'm about to break
I 'm about to break
This room to breathe
I cannot take this anymore
Saying everything I 've said before
All these words , they make no sence
I found bliss in ignorance
Less I hear , the less you say
You 'll find that out anyway
I find the answers aren't so clear
Wish I could find a way to disappear
All these thoughts , they make no sence
I found bliss in ignorance
Nothing seems to go away
Over and over again
Just like before
Everything you say to me
And I 'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
And I 'm about to break
Everything you say to me
And I 'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
And I 'm about to break
These are the places where I can feel torn from my body
My flesh , it peels during this rightly , concurring , balmy night
I 'm about to break
Waiting alone , I cannot resist
Feeling this hate , I have never missed
Please , someone , give me a reason to rip off my face
Blood is a pouring
And pouring
Shut up when I 'm talking to you
Shut up
Blood is pouring
Shut up
Blood is pouring
Shut up
Blood is pouring
Shut up when I 'm talking to you
Shut up
Blood is pouring
Shut up
Blood is pouring
Shut up
Blood is pouring
Shut up
I 'm about to break
Everything you say to me
And I 'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
And I 'm about to break
Everything you say to me
And I 'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
And I 'm about to
Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I 'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
' Cause I 'm one step closer to the edge
And I 'm about to break
Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I 'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
' Cause I 'm one step closer to the edge
And I 'm about to
They 're just living in my head
And since I fell for that spell
I am living there as well
Oh .
Time is so short and I 'm sure
There must be something more
Those who are dead are not dead
They 're just living in my head oh
And since I fell for that spell
I am living there as well oh
Time is so short and I 'm sure
There must be something more
You thought you might be a ghost
You didn't get to heaven but you made it close
You thought you might be a ghost
You didn't get to heaven but you made it close
You didn't get to heaven but you oh-oh-ooh , oh-oh-ooh
Oh oh
Those who are dead are not dead
They 're just living in my head
Oh .
You 're in control , is there anything you wanna know ?
The future 's for discovering
The space in which we 're travelling
From the top of the first page
To the end of the last day
From the start in your own way
You just want somebody listening to what you say
It doesn't matter who you are
Under the surface trying to break through
Deciphering the codes in you
I need a compass , draw me a map
I 'm on the top , I can't get back
Whoa whoa
The first line on the first page
To the end of the last page
From the start in your own way
You just want somebody listening to what you say
It doesn't matter who you are
You just want
Somebody listening to what you say
Oh , you just want somebody listening to what you say
It doesn't matter who you are
Is there anybody out there who
Is lost and hurt and lonely too
Are they bleeding all your colours into one ?
and if you come undone
As if you 've been run through
Some catapult it fired you
You wonder if your chance will ever come
Or if you 're stuck in square one
And the cat 's caught in the dryer
Philosophy 's a liar when
Your home is your headstone
" Icon " is the last chance for hope
When there 's no such thing as heroes
Your faith lies in the ditch that
You dug yourself in
Last chance to piss it all away
Nothing but hell to pay
When the lights are going down
Deadbeat Holiday - celebrate your own decay
There 's a vacant sign that 's hanging high
On a noose over your home
Deadbeat Holiday - get on your knees and pray
There 's a vacant sign that 's hanging high
But at least you 're not alone
Christmas lights in the middle of August
Grudges come back to haunt us
Your oldest allies are your long lost enemies
Grounded in a duplex to find that
You 're living on a landmine
Vacation hotspots is a cemetery drive
Last chance to piss it all away
Nothing but hell to pay
When the lights are going down
Deadbeat Holiday - celebrate your own decay
There 's a vacant sign that 's hanging high
On a noose over your home
Deadbeat Holiday - get on your knees and pray
There 's a vacant sign that 's hanging high
But at least you 're not alone
Last chance to piss it all away
Nothing but hell to pay when all you
Want to do is . not to . give up .
My brain drifts back to better days we 've been through
Like sitting on blacktop of the school grounds
The love I witched about I finally found
But now it 's gone and I take the blame
So there 's nothing I can do but take the pain
Why
Now I dwell on what you remind me of
A sweet young girl who sacrificed her love
As for me . I am blind without a cause
And now I reazlied what I have lost
It was something real that I could have had
Now I play the fool whose stable soul 's gone bad
Why
Tell me the words I might have said
That 's pumping pressure deep inside my head
Was it bad enough to be too late
Just tell me the words I might have ate
But now it 's gone and I take the blame
So there 's nothing I can do but take the pain
Why
I missed the good part then I realised
I started looking and the bubble burst
I started looking for excuses
Come on in
I 've got to tell you what a state I 'm in
I 've got to tell you in my loudest tones
That I started looking for a warning sign
When the truth is
I miss you
Yeah the truth is
That I miss you so .
A warning sign
You came back to haunt me and I realised
That you were an island and I passed you by
And you were an island to discover
Come on in
I 've got to tell you what a state I 'm in
I 've got to tell you in my loudest tones
That I started looking for a warning sign
When the truth is
I miss you
Yeah the truth is
That I miss you so
And I 'm tired
I should not have let you go
So I crawl back into your open arms
Yes I crawl back into your open arms
And I crawl back into your open arms
Yes I crawl back into your open arms
Oh I 'm an outsider outside of everything
everything you know
it disturbs me so
Oh I 'm an outsider outside of everything
Everything you know
It disturbs me so
Everybody 's gotta push me
Push me around
Everybody tryed to put me
Tryed to put me down
I messed up everyone
I 've already had all my fun
More troubles are gonna come
I 've already had all my fun
Oh yeah yeah yeah
Everybody try to push me
Push me around
Everybody try to put me
Try to put me down
Oh I 'm an outsider outside of everything
Everything you know
It disturbs me so
The morning is for sleeping
Through the dark streets they go searching to seek God in their own way ,
Save the nighttime for your weeping
Your weeping
Singing la lalalala la le
And the night over London rang .
So we rode down to the river where the toiling ghosts strain
for their curses to be broken
We 'd go underneath the arches where the witches are in there saying
There are ghost towns in the ocean
The ocean
Singing la lalalala la le
And the night over London rang .
God is in the houses and God is in my head and all the cemeteries in London
I see God come in my garden , but I don't know what he said ,
For my heart , it wasn't open
Not open
Singing la lalalala la le
and the night over London rang .
Singing la lalalala la le
There 's no light over London today .
Is love sweet love ,
That 's the only thing ,
That 's there 's just too little of .
Explosives duct taped to my spine
Nothings gonna change my mind
I won't listen to anyone 's last words
There 's nothing left for you to say
Soon you 'll be dead anyway
No one here is getting out alive
This time I 've really lost my mind and I don't care
So close your eyes
And kiss yourself goodbye
And think about the times you spent and what they 've ment
To me its nothing .
I 'm losing all my happiness
The happiness YOU pinned on me
Loneliness still comforts me
My anger DWELLS inside of me
I 'm taking it all out on you
And all the shoot you put me through
No one here is getting out alive
This time I 've really lost my mind and I don't care
So close your eyes
And kiss yourself goodbye
And think about the times you spent and what they 've ment
To me its nothing .
Do you ever thing back to another time
Does it bring you so down that you thought you lost you 're mind
Do you ever want to lead a long trail of destruction
and mow down any BULLSHIT that comfronts you
Do you ever build up all the small things in your head
To make one problem that adds up to NOTHING
To me its nothing .
feeling so faithless
lost under the surface
I don't know what you 're expecting of me
put under the pressure
of walking in your shoes
[ caught in the undertow , just caught in the undertow ]
every step that I take is another mistake to you .
[ caught in the undertow , just caught in the undertow ]
I 've
become so numb
I can't feel you there
become so tired
so much more aware
I 'm becoming this
all I want to do
is be more like me
and be less like you .
Can't you see that you 're smothering me
holding too tightly
afraid to lose control
cause everything that you thought I would be
has fallen apart right in front of you .
[ caught in the undertow , just caught in the undertow ]
every step that I take is another mistake to you
[ caught in the undertow , just caught in the undertow ]
and every second I waste is more than I can take .
I 've
become so numb
I can't feel you there
become so tired
so much more aware
I 'm becoming this
all I want to do
is be more like me
and be less like you .
And I know
I may end up failing too
But I know
you were just like me
with someone disappointed in you .
I 've
become so numb
I can't feel you there
become so tired
so much more aware
I 'm becoming this
all I want to do
is be more like me
and be less like you .
I 've
become so numb
I can't feel you there
[ tired of being what you want me to be ]
( repeat )
They 're getting over the hill
Death is closing in and catching up
As far as I can tell
Got a plan of action and cold blood
And it smells of defiance
I 'll just wait for Mom and Dad to die
And got my inheritance
Now I want more
' Cause I 'm getting bored
And I 'm going nowhere fast
I was once filled with doubt
Now it 's all figured out
Nothing good can last
Crows feet and rot are setting in
And time is running out
My parent 's income interest rate
Is gaining higher clout
I 'm a snot nosed slob
Without a job
And I know I darn well should
Mom and Dad don't look so hot these days
But my future 's looking good
Now I want more
' Cause I 'm getting bored
And I 'm going nowhere fast
I was once filled with doubt
Now it 's all figured out
Nothing good can last
Now I want more
' Cause I 'm getting bored
And I 'm going nowhere fast
I was once filled with doubt
Now it 's all figured out
Nothing good can last
Your gonna miss me miss me when I 'm gone
Can't you see there 's something wrong
Gonna miss me miss me when I 'm gone
On a night just like tonight
Below my window pussies fight
I 'm gonna be so far away
Exactly like you are today
You must have thought you really scored
' Cause we 're the Angel and the Jerk
You know I love to be ignored
Just take for granted all my work
Your gonna miss me miss me when I 'm gone
Can't you see there 's something wrong
Your Gonna miss me miss me when I 'm gone
Look at me .
Who do you see ?.
Am I a mirror to your moods .?
Today 's the day .
I break away .
I 'm pulling on my walking boots
Your gonna miss me miss me when I 'm gone
Wake up , stupid ! something 's wrong
Gonna miss me miss me when I 'm gone
I always hope you 'd be the one
That 's gonna meet me eye-to-eye
I must be brighter than the sun
Or else you 've gone completely shy
Am I handy poltergeist ?
By day a busy little elf
A saint to rival Jesus Christ
You 'd better feed and clothe yourself
Your gonna miss me miss me .
A little bit of loneliness
A little bit of disregard
Handful of complaints
But I can't help the fact
That everyone can see these scars
I am
What I want you to want
What I want you to feel
But it 's like no matter what I do
I can't convince you
To just believe this is real
So I
Let go watching you
Turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I 'm not
But I 'll be here cause
You are all that I 've got
I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored
Time won't heal
this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored
I am
A little bit insecure
A little unconfident
' Cause you don't understand
I do what I can
But sometimes I don't make sense
I am
What you never want to say
But I 've never had a doubt
But it 's like no matter what I do
I can't convince you
For once just to hear me out
So I
Let go
Watching you
Turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I 'm not
But I 'll be here cause you 're all that I got
( got )
I can't feel
The way I did before
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored
Time won't heal
this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored
Noooo !
Hear me out now
You 're gonna listen to me
Like it or not
Right now
Hear me out now
You 're gonna listen to me
Like it or not
Right now
I can't feel
The way I did before
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored !
I can't feel
The way I did before
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored
Time won't heal
This damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored
I can't feel
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored
Time won't heal
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored .

Knew if I paid my dues , how will they pay you
When you first come in the game , they try to play you
Then you drop a couple of hits , look how they wave to you
From Marcy to Madison Square
To the only thing that matters in just a matter of years ( yea )
As fate would have it , Jay 's status appears
to be at an all-time high , perfect time to say goodbye
When I come back like Jordan , wearin the 4-5
It ain't to play games witchu
It 's to aim at you , probably maim you
If I owe you I 'm blowin you to smithereeens
Cocksucker take one for your team
And I need you to remember one thing ( one thing )
I came , I saw , I conquered
From record sales , to sold out concerts
So muh'fucker if you want this encore
I need you to scream , ' til your lungs get sore
I 'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless lost under the surface
Don't know what you 're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
( Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow )
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
( Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow )
And every second I waste is more than I can take
I 've become so numb I can't feel you there
I 've become so tired so much more aware
I 'm becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you
I 've become so numb
Can I get an encore , do you want more ( more . )
I 've become so numb
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
One last time I need y'all to roar
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
Hit me
Got Mike
He 's got the rap patrol on the gat patrol
Foes that wanna make sure his casket 's closed
Rap critics that say he 's " Money Cash Hoes "
He 's from the hood stupid what type of facts are those
If you grew up with holes in your zapitos
You 'd celebrate the minute you was having doe
So fuck critics you can kiss our whole asshole
If you don't like my lyrics you can press fast forward
Got beef with radio if we don't play they show
They don't play out hits well we don't give a shit SO
All these mags try and use our ass
So advertisers can give ' em more cash for ads . fuckers
I don't know what you take us as
or understand the intelligence that Jay-Z has
I 'm from rags to ritches nigga we ain't dumb
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
Hit me
99 Problems but a bitch ain't one
If you having girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
The year is ' 94 and in my trunk is raw
In my rear view mirror is the motherfucking law
I got two choices you 'll pull over the car or
Bounce on the devil put the pedal to the floor
Now I ain't trying to see no highway chase with Jake
Plus I got a few dollars I can fight the case
So I . pull over to the side of the road
And I heard " Son , do you know why I 'm stopping you for ? "
' Cause I 'm young and I 'm black and my hat 's real low
" Do I look like a mind reader sir , I don't know
Am I under arrest or should I guess some more ? "
" Well you was doing fifty five in a fifty four "
" License and registration and step out of the car "
" Are you carrying a weapon on you - I know a lot of you are "
I ain't stepping out of shit all my papers legit
" Do you mind if I look round the car a little bit ? "
Well my glove compartment is locked so is the trunk and the back
And I know my rights so you gon ' need a warrant for that
" Aren't you sharp as a tack are some type of lawyer or something ? "
" Or somebody important or something ? "
Nah I ain't pass the bar but I know a little bit
Enough that you won't illegally search my shit
" Well see how smart you are when the 9 's come "
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
Hit me
99 Problems but a bitch ain't one
If you having girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
Hit me 99 Problems but a bitch ain't one
If you having girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
Hit me
99 Problems but a bitch ain't one
If you having girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
Now once upon a time not too long ago
A nigga like myself had to strong arm a hoe
This is not a hoe in the sense of having a pussy
But a pussy having no god damn sense , try and push me
I tried to ignore him and talk to the Lord
Pray for him , ' cause some fool 's just love to perform
You know the type loud as a motor bike
But wouldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight
The only thing that 's gonna happen is I'mma get to clapping
He and his boys gon ' be yapping to the captain
And there I go trapped in the kit kat again
Back through the system with the riff raff again
Fiends on the floor scratching again
Paparazzis with theie cameras snapping them
D.A. tried to give the nigga the shaft again
Half-a-mil for bail ' cause I 'm African
All because this fool was harassing them
Trying to play the boy like he 's scaring
But ain't nothing sweet ' bout how I hold my gun
I got 99 problems but this bitch ain't one
99 Problems but a bitch ain't one
If you having girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
Hit me
99 Problems but a bitch ain't one
If you having girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
Hit me
Shut up when I 'm talking to you
Shut up , shut up , shut up
Shut up when I 'm talking to you
Shut up , shut up , shut up
I 'm about to BREAK
Everything you say to me
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
Hit me
I need a little room to breathe
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
Hit me
Everything you say to me
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
Hit me
I need a little room to breathe
I got 99 problems
And I 'm about to
Break
I had nothing to say
And I get lost in the nothingness inside of me
( I was confused )
And I let it all out to find
That I 'm not the only person with these things in mind
( Inside of me )
But all that they can see the words revealed
Is the only real thing that I 've got left to feel
( Nothing to lose )
Just stuck , hollow and alone
And the fault is my own , and the fault is my own
( chorus )
I wanna heal , I wanna feel what I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I 've felt so long
( Erase all the pain till it 's gone )
I wanna heal , I wanna feel like I 'm close to something real
I wanna find something I 've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong
And I 've got nothing to say
I can't believe I didn't fall right down on my face
( I was confused )
Looking everywhere only to find
That it 's not the way I had imagined it all in my mind
( So what am I )
What do I have but negativity
' Cause I can't justify way everyone is looking at me
( Nothing to lose )
Nothing to gain , hollow and alone
And the fault is my own , and the fault is my own
( Repeat chorus )
I will never know
Myself until I do this on my own
And I will never feel
Anything else until my wounds are healed
I will never be
Anything till I break away from me
I will break away
I 'll find myself today
( Repeat chorus )
I wanna heal , I wanna feel like I 'm somewhere I belong
Somewhere I belong
I 'm calling your name
hecko Or is this goodbye
The gleam in your eyes
It troubles my brain
Will I see it again
So I can rest my head
Angel . Angel ! Dancing away
As all of my thoughts get rearranged
Angel . Angel ! Turning away
Just when thing seem
To have changed
So I can rest my head
Hey can you hear me
I 'm calling your name
hecko Or is this goodbye
The gleam in your eyes
It troubles my brain
Will I see it again
So I can rest my head
What 's the time
I 'd say the time is right .
Here 's to me .
Let 's find another reason .
Down the hatch and a bad attitude .
Salud .
Wasting time
Wasting time down a bum freak road .
And I don't know where the heck it 'll go .
Heirlooms and huffing fumes , and I 'm picking up the pace
and I 'm gonna smash straight into a wall .
All the time .
A " New Year 's Resolution "
How soon that we forget .
Doing time .
Loving every minute .
Live it up on another let down .
Salud .
Promises , promises , it was all set in stone , cross my heart and hope to die .
Sugar fix , dirty tricks and a trick question .
Guess i should have read between the lines .
Having the time of my life , watching the clock tick .
All the time , where did all the time go
It 's too late to say goodnight .
Time flies when you 're having fun .
Time 's up when you work like a dog .
Salud .
To the cold of the static / and put my cold feet on the floor
Forgot all about yesterday
Remembering I 'm pretending to be where I 'm not anymore
A little taste of hypocrisy
And I 'm left in the wake of the mistake / slow to react
Even though you 're so close to me
You 're still so distant / And I can't bring you back
It 's true / the way I feel
Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories
Even if you 're not with me
I 'm with you
You / Now I see/ keeping everything inside
You / Now I see / Even when I close my eyes
I hit you and you hit me back
We fall to the floor / the rest of the day stands still
Fine line between this and that
When things go wrong I pretend the past isn't real
Now I 'm trapped in this memory
And I 'm left in the wake of the mistake / slow to react
Even though you 're close to me
You 're still so distant / And I can't bring you back
no
No matter how far we 've come
I can't wait to see tomorrow
With you
All the we fall for
All those places we 've grown
All of us are done for
We live in a beautiful world ,
Yeah we do , yeah we do ,
We live in a beautiful world ,
Oh , we 're sinking like stones
All the we fall for
Homes , places we 've grown
All of us are done for
We live in a beautiful world ,
Yeah we do , yeah we do ,
We live in a beautiful world .
Oh , all that I know ,
There 's nothing here to run from ,
And there , everybody here 's got somebody to lean on .
Go with me all the time .
And in the dead of night
Tell me you will be mine .
Where do you go to , pretty baby ?
Where do you go to , when the night wins away .
Ask me so sweetly , what do I do ?
Who do I sing for ?
Well honey I sing about you .
You .
My mother went to the grocery store .
Went sneaking throught her bedroom door to find something in a size 4 .
Sugar and spice and everything nice wasn't made for only girls .
GI Joe in panty hose is making room for the one and only .
King for a day , princess by dawn .
King for a day in a leather thong .
King for a day , princess by dawn .
Just wait ' til all the guys get a load of me .
My daddy threw me in therapy .
He thinks I 'm not a real man .
Who put the drag in the drag queen .
Don't knock it until you tried it
This is a public service anouncement , this is only a test
Emergency evacuation process
May Impair your ability to operate machinery
Can't quite tell just what it means to me
Keep out of reach of children , don't you talk to strangers
Get your philoshophy from a bumper sticker

the eyes ease open and it 's dark again
From the top to the bottom
Bottom to top I stop
At the core I 've forgotten
In the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety
The picture 's there
The memory won't escape me
But why should I care
In the memory you 'll find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up
Listen to the sound , dizzy from the ups and downs
And nauseated by the polluted rock that 's all around
Watchin the wheels of cars that pass
I look past to the last of the light and the long shadows it casts
A window grows and captures the eye
And cries out yellow light as it passes me by
And a young , shadowy figure sits in front of a box
Inside a building of rocks with antennas on top
Now , nothing can stop in this land of the pain
The same lose , not knowing they were part of the game
While the insides change , the box stays the same
And the figure inside could bear anybody 's name
The memories I keep are from a time like then
I put on my paper so I could come back to them
Someday I 'm hopin to close my eyes and pretend
That this crumpled up paper can be perfect again
From the top to the bottom
Bottom to top I stop
At the core I 've forgotten
In the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety
The picture 's there
The memory won't escape me
I 'm here at the podium talking , the ceremonial offerings
Dedicated to urban dysfunctional offspring
What 's happened
City governments are eternally napping
Trapped in greedy covenants , causin urban collapsing
Bullets that scar souls , with dark holds , get more than your car stole
Some hearts be blacker than charcoal
For real , this society 's deprivation depends not on our differences , but the separation within
No preparation is made , limited age , minimum wage
Livin in a tenement cage for innocent pay
Tragedy within a parade
The darkness overspreads like permanent plauge
I 'm the forgotten
In the memory you 'll find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up
Reminds me of the times we shared .
Makes me wish that you were here .
Now it seems I 've forgotten my purpose in this life .
All the songs have been erased .
Guess I 've learned from my mistakes .
Open the past and present .
Now and we are there .
Story to tell and I am listening .
Open the past and present .
And the future too .
It 's all I 've got and I 'm giving it up to you .
Loose ends tied in knots .
Leaving a lump down in my throat .
Gagging on a souvenir .
Lodged to fill another year .
Drag it on and on until my skin is ripped to shreds .
Leaving myself wide open .
Living out a sacrifice .
If you got no one and I 've got no place to go , would it be alright
Could it be alright
