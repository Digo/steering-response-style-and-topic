. Like we 're being watched .	Away put your weapon . I mean you no harm .
I 'm looking for someone .	Looking ? Looking ? You 've found someone I 'd say . Heh ? Yes !
Looking ? Looking ? You 've found someone I 'd say . Heh ? Yes !	Yeah .
Yeah .	Help you I can . yes . yes .
Help you I can . yes . yes .	I 'm looking for a great warrior .
I 'm looking for a great warrior .	A great warrior ? Not many on those . Wars don't make one great .
Listen , friend , we didn't mean to land here , and if I could get my fighter out of this puddle I would , but I can't . So .	Can't get your ship out ? Have you tried ? Have you tried ?
Give me that !	Mine ! Mine ! Or I 'll help you not .
I don't want your help . I want my lamp back . I 'll need it in this slimy mudhole .	Mudhole ? Slimy ? My home this is .
Mine , mine .	Okay , Artoo , let him have it . Now get out of here , little fellow , we 've got things to do .
Okay , Artoo , let him have it . Now get out of here , little fellow , we 've got things to do .	No , no ! I 'll stay and help you find your friend .
No , no ! I 'll stay and help you find your friend .	I 'm not looking for a friend . I 'm looking for a Jedi Master .
I 'm not looking for a friend . I 'm looking for a Jedi Master .	Oh , a Jedi Master . Different altogether . Yoda you seek , Yoda .
Oh , a Jedi Master . Different altogether . Yoda you seek , Yoda .	You know the Jedi Master ?
You know the Jedi Master ?	Of course , yes . But now eat we must . Good food , I have good food . Come , come .
. I told you , I 'm not hungry .	Patience . It 's time to eat .
Patience . It 's time to eat .	Look , it smells good . I 'm sure it 's delicious But I don't know why we can't see Yoda now .
Look , it smells good . I 'm sure it 's delicious But I don't know why we can't see Yoda now .	It 's the Jedi 's time to eat , too .
It 's the Jedi 's time to eat , too .	Will it take long to get there ? How far away is he ?
Will it take long to get there ? How far away is he ?	Not far , not far . Be patient . Soon you will see him . Why wish you become a Jedi ?
Not far , not far . Be patient . Soon you will see him . Why wish you become a Jedi ?	Because of my father , I guess .
Because of my father , I guess .	Oh , your father . a powerful Jedi was he , powerful Jedi .
Oh , your father . a powerful Jedi was he , powerful Jedi .	How could you know my father ? You don't even know who I am . Can't we get on with this already ?
Yes sir !	Sergeant , is Commander Skywalker back yet ?
Sergeant , is Commander Skywalker back yet ?	I haven't seen him . He probably came in through the south entrance .
I haven't seen him . He probably came in through the south entrance .	Probably isn't good enough , Sergeant . Check on it !
Commander Skywalker hasn't come through the south entrance , sir . Maybe he slipped by without checking in .	Not likely ! Where are the speeders ?
Not likely ! Where are the speeders ?	We haven't got them adapted to this cold yet .
We haven't got them adapted to this cold yet .	We 'll have to go out on Tauntauns .
We 'll have to go out on Tauntauns .	The temperature is dropping too fast .
The temperature is dropping too fast .	You bet it is . and Luke 's out in it .
The night storms will start before you can reach the first marker .	Then I 'll see you in Hell .
What is thy bidding , My Master ?	There is a grave disturbance in The Force .
There is a grave disturbance in The Force .	I have felt it .
I have felt it .	Our situation is most precarious . We have a new enemy who could bring about our destruction .
Our situation is most precarious . We have a new enemy who could bring about our destruction .	Our destruction ? Who ?
Our destruction ? Who ?	The son of Skywalker . You must destroy him . or he will be our undoing .
The son of Skywalker . You must destroy him . or he will be our undoing .	He 's not a Jedi , he 's just a boy . Obi-wan could not have taught him so much that .
He 's not a Jedi , he 's just a boy . Obi-wan could not have taught him so much that .	You are weak ! I have seen it . The Force is strong with him . He must be destroyed .
You are weak ! I have seen it . The Force is strong with him . He must be destroyed .	But , if he could be turned , he would be a powerful ally .
But , if he could be turned , he would be a powerful ally .	Yes . yes . That would be a great asset .
Yes . yes . That would be a great asset .	He will join us or die , My Master .
Captain Solo . What 's the situation ?	There isn't a hint of life in the area . But all the perimeter markers are set , so you 'll know if anyone comes calling .
There isn't a hint of life in the area . But all the perimeter markers are set , so you 'll know if anyone comes calling .	Good , and Commander Skywalker ?
Good , and Commander Skywalker ?	He 's checking out a meteorite that hit near him . He 'll be in soon .
He 's checking out a meteorite that hit near him . He 'll be in soon .	With all the meteor activity in this system , it 's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships .
With all the meteor activity in this system , it 's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships .	The Empire won't look for you out here . I 'd say you 're all set . which means it 's time for me to get going .
That 's right .	You 're an extraordinary fighter . I hate to lose you .
You 're an extraordinary fighter . I hate to lose you .	Thank you , General . But there 's a price on my head . If I don't pay off Jabba the Hutt , I 'm a walking dead man .
Thank you , General . But there 's a price on my head . If I don't pay off Jabba the Hutt , I 'm a walking dead man .	I understand . A death mark is not an easy thing to live with . Until our paths cross again , may the force be with you .
Whatever it is , it isn't friendly . I 'm going to have a look . Come on , Chewie .	Wait . I 'll send a patrol with you .
Wait . I 'll send a patrol with you .	Fine . But they 'll have to take care of themselves .
Captain Solo , sir . Might I have a word with you ?	What is it ?
What is it ?	Mistress Leia has been trying to reach you on the communicator , but either you have it turned off , or it is malfunctioning . if it 's damaged , Artoo , could fix it , if you like .
Mistress Leia has been trying to reach you on the communicator , but either you have it turned off , or it is malfunctioning . if it 's damaged , Artoo , could fix it , if you like .	I shut it off . What 's her royal holiness want ?
I shut it off . What 's her royal holiness want ?	She is looking for Master Luke , and assumed he would be here with you . No one seems to know .
I don't know , Artoo . Sir , might I inquire what 's going on ?	Go tell your precious Princess . Luke is dead unless he shows up soon .
He doesn't make sense to me either , Chewie .	I do hope he 's all there . if you take my meaning . I would hate to see Master Luke develop a short circuit .
I do hope he 's all there . if you take my meaning . I would hate to see Master Luke develop a short circuit .	The kid ran into something mean , and it wasn't the cold .
Transport XJ . get out of here . Go !	The energy shield is down . We 'll be stuck here forever .
Sir , I was wondering .	Sit down , and shut up !
Sit down , and shut up !	It can wait .
I think we 're in trouble .	If I may say so , Sir , I noticed earlier that the entire main para- light system seems to be damaged .
If I may say so , Sir , I noticed earlier that the entire main para- light system seems to be damaged .	We 're in trouble !
What are you so grouchy about ?	Sir , I 'm almost afraid to ask , but does shutting down all but emergency power systems include me ?
You , too , golden rod .	I must admit there are times I don't understand human behavior .
It sounds like it 's trying to get in .	I 'm going to see what it is .
We 're doomed . Goodbye , Mistress Leia . Goodbye , Captain .	Not collapsing , honey . It 's closing ! This is no cave .
I can see the edge of the asteroid field , sir .	Good . Soon as we 're clear , we 'll kick this baby into hyperdrive .
Yes , Your Highness ?	You said you were going to stay . What happened ?
You said you were going to stay . What happened ?	That bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind .
That bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind .	Does Luke know ?
Does Luke know ?	He 'll know when he gets back . Don't give me that look . Every day more bounty hunters are searching for me . If I don't pay off Jabba soon , there 'll be too many to stop . Remotes , Gank killers , and who knows what else . I 've got to get that price off my head while I still have a head .

Remotes , Gank killers , and who knows what else . I 've got to get that price off my head while I still have a head .	Han , we need you here .
Han , we need you here .	We ?
We ?	Yes .
Yes .	Not you ?
Not you ?	Me ? I don't know what you mean .
Me ? I don't know what you mean .	You probably don't . How could you ? You 're so terrified of your own emotions .
You probably don't . How could you ? You 're so terrified of your own emotions .	And what are they , pray tell ?
And what are they , pray tell ?	You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me .
You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me .	I respect you . You 're a bold fighter , maybe not the brightest , but . HAN No , your worship . That 's not what I 'm talking about .
Am I ? I say you came running after me because you were afraid I was leaving you without even a kiss .	I 'd just as soon kiss a wookiee .
I 'd just as soon kiss a wookiee .	There 's no accounting for taste . Believe me , you could use a good kiss . You 've spent so much time doing your duty and giving orders you 've never learned how to be a woman . It 's a shame , because you 've got all the makings for one . I could have helped you plenty in that department . if you 'd have let go for a minute . But it 's too late now , sweetheart . Your big opportunity is flying out of here .

It 's a shame , because you 've got all the makings for one . I could have helped you plenty in that department . if you 'd have let go for a minute . But it 's too late now , sweetheart . Your big opportunity is flying out of here .	We are fighting for a cause much .
We are fighting for a cause much .	Spare me please ! Don't tell me about the Rebellion again . I 've had it with your noble mission . All you let yourself think about is the Rebellion . The result is you 're as cold as this planet .
Spare me please ! Don't tell me about the Rebellion again . I 've had it with your noble mission . All you let yourself think about is the Rebellion . The result is you 're as cold as this planet .	And you think you 're the one to apply some heat ?
And you think you 're the one to apply some heat ?	Sure . If I were interested . But I don't think it 'd be much fun .
Those creatures he keeps talking about . we 'd better double the security . Han , I don't know how .	Forget it .
Now all we 've got to worry about is what attacked him .	No kidding . If this snowball 's got nasty natives , they could be anywhere .
. I 'm afraid there 's not much left .	What was it ?
What was it ?	Droid of some kind . I didn't hit it that hard . It must have had a self-destruct .
Droid of some kind . I didn't hit it that hard . It must have had a self-destruct .	An Imperial probe droid .
An Imperial probe droid .	Now don't panic . We don't know that .
Well , your worship , it looks like you arranged to keep me close by for a while longer .	I had nothing to do with it . General Rieekan thinks it 's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we know where that probe came from .
I don't know what he 's talking about .	Ooops ! I guess you haven't told Luke about that yet .
You must have gone completely out of your feeble mind .	Come on , your highness , are you telling me you haven't been thinking about that kiss ?
Why you low-down , stuck-up , half- witted , scruffy-looking nerf-herder .	Who 's scruffy-looking ? I tell ya ' sweetheart , I must 've hit pretty close to the mark to get you hoppin ' like this . Doesn't it look that way to you , Luke ?
Hey ! Someone 's still in here .	Wait , don't open it . that 's one of the traps for the ice creatures .
Would it help if I got out and pushed ?	Don't worry , your holiness , I 'll get her started .
This bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade .	This baby 's got a few surprises left in her .
This baby 's got a few surprises left in her .	I 'll be surprised if we ever start moving .
I know , I know , I see them . LEIA See what ?	Two more Star Destroyers heading right at us .
Two more Star Destroyers heading right at us .	I 'm glad you said there was going to be no problem , or I 'd be worried .
That was no laser blast . some- thing hit us .	Or you ran into something .
Asteroids ! Chewie , bank left , let 's find out where they 're coming from .	Probably an asteroid field .
Probably an asteroid field .	Let 's hope so . it 's just the chance we need .
Let 's hope so . it 's just the chance we need .	To get killed . you 're not seriously going into an asteroid field ?
To get killed . you 're not seriously going into an asteroid field ?	Aren't I ? Hang on , sweetheart . We 're gonna do some flyin ' .
Well , you said you wanted to be there when I was wrong .	I take it back .
I take it back .	That Star Destroyer is slowing down .
That Star Destroyer is slowing down .	Good .
But we 're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer .	I 'm against that .
I 'm against that .	We 've got to get out of this shower .
We 've got to get out of this shower .	Now you 're making sense .
Now you 're making sense .	Right . I 'm going to get in closer to one of these big ones .
There , there . Chewie get a reading on that . Looks pretty good .	What is it ?
What is it ?	That should do nicely .
Why , Princess , this is so sudden .	Very funny . You can let go now . I 'm getting angry .
Very funny . You can let go now . I 'm getting angry .	You don't look angry .
You don't look angry .	How do I look ?
How do I look ?	Beautiful .
Sorry , Captain , being held by you isn't enough to get me excited .	Well , I hope you don't expect more .
Well , I hope you don't expect more .	I don't expect anything , except to be left alone .
I don't expect anything , except to be left alone .	Fine with me . But I 'm afraid you 'll have to let go .
That was no earthquake .	Felt like a hydro concussion . an Imperial Cruiser .
They 're moving away .	They 're just trying to see if they can stir something up . we 're safe .
They 're just trying to see if they can stir something up . we 're safe .	Where have I heard that before ?
Easy , your worship . Only trying to help .	Would you please stop calling me that ?
Sure . I guess I make it difficult sometimes .	Yes , you do .
Yes , you do .	You could be a touch warmer , though . Admit it , against your better judgment you think I 'm all right .
Sometimes , maybe . occasionally , when you aren't acting like a scoundrel .	That 's quite a compliment .
Stop that .	Why ?
What are you afraid of ?	Afraid of ? Certainly not you Captain Solo . or any other man in this galaxy .
Don't count on it . I happen to like nice men .	Sure , they 're safer . You always know what they 're going to do . Trouble is , it gets a little dull .
Sure , they 're safer . You always know what they 're going to do . Trouble is , it gets a little dull .	There 's nothing dull about a man I can depend on to be civilized .
There 's nothing dull about a man I can depend on to be civilized .	You mean a man you can control .
You mean a man you can control .	I do not !
I do not !	Try and control this .
There 's something out there !	Where ?
Where ?	Outside , in the cave .
Are you crazy !	Look , we just got this bucket going again . I 'm not about to let some varmint tear it apart .
Looks like some kind of Mynock .	There will be more of them . They always travel in groups . And there 's nothing they like better than to attach themselves to ships . Just what we need right now .
Those Star Destroyers will spot us long before you can get into light speed . You can't make the jump in this asteroid field .	Strap yourself in , sweetheart , we 're taking off !
Strap yourself in , sweetheart , we 're taking off !	But the tremors have stopped .
I see it Chewie , hang on .	The entrance is collapsing !
Couldn't be , I checked the transfer circuits , just like you said ! I tell you this time it 's not my fault . I 'm sure I checked it .	No lightspeed ?
No lightspeed ?	It 's not my fault . I can't under- stand it !
Sharp bank , Chewie . Let 's turn this bucket around . You heard me , turn around ! Full power on the front shield .	You 're going to attack them ?!
You could have warned him before you shut him off .	Oh , so sorry ! Didn't mean to offend your droid . You think braking and shutting down in that amount of time is easy ?
Oh , so sorry ! Didn't mean to offend your droid . You think braking and shutting down in that amount of time is easy ?	I 'm still not sure what you 've accomplished .
I 'm still not sure what you 've accomplished .	Chewie , check the manual release on the landing claws .
What 'd you have in mind for your next move ?	The fleet is finally breaking up . I 'm hoping they 'll follow standard Imperial procedure and dump their garbage before they go into light speed .
Not bad , hot shot , not bad . Then what ?	Then we have to find a safe port around here . Got any ideas ?
Then we have to find a safe port around here . Got any ideas ?	That depends . Where are we ?
That depends . Where are we ?	Here . near the Anoat system .
Funny , I have the feeling I 've been in this area before . Let me check my logs .	You keep logs ? My , how organized .
You keep logs ? My , how organized .	Well , sometimes . Ah-hah , I knew it ! Lando Calrissian .
Well , sometimes . Ah-hah , I knew it ! Lando Calrissian .	Never heard of that system .
Never heard of that system .	Lando 's not a system , he 's a man . A gambler , con-artist . all- around scoundrel . . your kind of guy . The system is called Bespin . It 's a ways from here , but reachable .
Lando 's not a system , he 's a man . A gambler , con-artist . all- around scoundrel . . your kind of guy . The system is called Bespin . It 's a ways from here , but reachable .	A mining colony .
A mining colony .	A Tibanna gas mine . Lando won it in a sabacc match , or so he claims . Lando and I go way back .
A Tibanna gas mine . Lando won it in a sabacc match , or so he claims . Lando and I go way back .	Can you trust him ?
Can you trust him ?	No . But he has no love for the Empire , that much I know .
You do have your moments . Not many , but you do have them .	Let er go , Chewie .
I don't like this .	It 'll be all right . Trust me . And keep your eyes open . You wait here .
What are you staring at ?	Who 's staring ?
Who 's staring ?	You look silly .
You look silly .	You look great .
You look great .	Has Threepio turned up yet ?
Has Threepio turned up yet ?	Huh ? Oh . Your droid 's been gone too long just to be lost . He may have gotten into some trouble . Chewie went to look for him . Come over here . I want to check this out .
I hope Luke made it to the fleet all right .	Luke ! I 'm sure he 's fine . Probably sitting around wondering what we 're doing right now .
He found him in a junk pile .	Something 's wrong here . Your friend Lando is very charming , but I don't trust him .
Something 's wrong here . Your friend Lando is very charming , but I don't trust him .	Well , I do trust him . Lando 's an old friend . Must have been an accident .
Well , I do trust him . Lando 's an old friend . Must have been an accident .	Chewie , do you think you can repair him ?
No thanks .	Look , sweetheart , I 'm not going to have you accusing my friend of .
I was worried about you .	I 'm worried about all of us . I can't figure out what they 're up to .
I 'm worried about all of us . I can't figure out what they 're up to .	Me either . They had me howling on the scan grid , but they never asked me any questions .
. I love you . I couldn't tell you before , but it 's true .	. just remember that , cause I 'll be back .
Loud and clear , kid . What 's up ?	I 've finished my circle and I haven't picked up any life read- ings .
I 've finished my circle and I haven't picked up any life read- ings .	There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser . My sentry markers are placed . I 'm heading back to the base .
There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser . My sentry markers are placed . I 'm heading back to the base .	I 'll see you shortly . A meteorite just hit the ground near here and I want to check it out . Won't be long .
Hi kid , you look strong enough to wrestle a Gundark .	Thanks to you .
Thanks to you .	That 's two you owe me , junior .
Probe ? What probe ?	That makes a good story . But I think you just can't bear to let me out of your sight .
About what ?	Now don't get the wrong idea , pal . She was just trying to express her true feelings for me .
I hope you make your peace with Jabba .	Don't worry . You haven't seen the last of us .
Why you slimy , double-crossing no-good swindler . am I glad to see you .	No hard feelings ?
No hard feelings ?	Are you kidding ?
Are you kidding ?	I always said you were a gentleman .
I always said you were a gentleman .	I 'll bet .
That won't be easy , my friend . What brings you here , anyway ?	Repairs .
Repairs .	What have you done to my ship ?
That ship saved my life a few times . It 's the fastest hunk of machinery in the galaxy . What 's wrong with her ?	Hyperdrive .
Hyperdrive .	I 'll have my people get to work on it right away . Hate the thought of the Millennium Falcon without her heart .
How 's your mining operation going ?	Not as well as I 'd like . We 're a small outpost and not very self- sufficient . I 've had supply problems of every kind and . What 's so funny ?
Not as well as I 'd like . We 're a small outpost and not very self- sufficient . I 've had supply problems of every kind and . What 's so funny ?	Nothing . I never would have guessed that underneath that wild schemer I knew was a respon- sible leader and businessman . But you wear it well .
Sorry friend , I had no choice . They arrived right before you did .	I 'm sorry too .
Get out of here , Lando !	Shut up a minute and listen . I 'm doing what I can to make this easier for you .
Shut up a minute and listen . I 'm doing what I can to make this easier for you .	This ought to be good .
This ought to be good .	Vader agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me . They 'll have to stay here , but at least they 'll be safe .
You don't know much about much if you think Vader won't want us dead before this is over .	He doesn't want you at all . He 's after someone named Skywalker .
He doesn't want you at all . He 's after someone named Skywalker .	Luke ? I don't get it .
All this just to get the kid ? What 's so important about him ?	Don't ask me , but he 's on his way .
Don't shoot ! I 've done what I can for you . I 'm sorry it 's not better , but I 've got my own problems . I 've already stuck my neck out further than I should .	Yeah , you 're a real hero .
What about Leia and the Wookiee ?	You will find them well enough . But they must never again leave this city .
You will find them well enough . But they must never again leave this city .	That was never mentioned . Neither was this bounty hunter taking Han . I hope you haven't forgotten our bargain .
That was never mentioned . Neither was this bounty hunter taking Han . I hope you haven't forgotten our bargain .	I forget nothing , Calrissian . Perhaps you think you 're being treated unfairly .
I forget nothing , Calrissian . Perhaps you think you 're being treated unfairly .	No .
No .	Good . It would be most unfortunate if I had to leave a permanent garrison here .
We only use this chamber for carbon freezing . If you put him in there , it 'll kill him .	I think not . But I don't wish my prize to be damaged . We 'll test it first . Bring in Captain Solo .
I 'll take what 's mine now .	Take them , but I 'm keeping a detachment of troops here to watch over them .
Take them , but I 'm keeping a detachment of troops here to watch over them .	That wasn't the bargain . You said the Empire wouldn't interfere in-
That wasn't the bargain . You said the Empire wouldn't interfere in-	I 'm altering the bargain . Pray I don't alter it any further .
Hello ! What have we here ? Welcome , I am Baron Lando Calrissian , Administrator of this facility . and who might you be ?	You may call me Leia .
Sorry , am I interrupting anything ?	Not really .
Not really .	I must say , your beauty is unpar- alleled . Truly you belong here with us among the clouds .
I must say , your beauty is unpar- alleled . Truly you belong here with us among the clouds .	Thanks .
Thanks .	Would you care to join me for a little refreshment ?
. We are a free station and do not fall under the jurisdiction of the Empire .	You 're part of the mining guild then ?
You 're part of the mining guild then ?	Not actually . Our operation is small enough not to be noticed , so you might say we 're enterprisers . Most of our trade is , well . unofficial .
It 's a lovely outpost .	Yes , we keep pollution down by having the power reactor far below the city . It 's connected by a transfer shaft .
What about Han ?	I didn't know you had a price on your head . Vader has given you to the bounty hunter .
Lord Vader has set a trap for him and .	. we 're the bait .
What 's going on ?	I 'm coming over to your side , that 's what . And I have a feeling I 'm making a big mistake .
I 'm coming over to your side , that 's what . And I have a feeling I 'm making a big mistake .	And when do you betray us again ?
Look , I stand to lose everything by this .	We have no use for your kind .
We have no use for your kind .	This is no time to be choosy , honey . What do you say we debate this later ? There 's still a chance I can get you out of here .
Chewie 's right . We must try to save Han .	There 's not much chance , but the bounty hunter 's ship is on the East Landing Platform .
Very noble . Not smart , but noble .	You 've probably never done an honorable thing in your life .
You 've probably never done an honorable thing in your life .	Sure I did . once . It turned out lousy .
Sure I did . once . It turned out lousy .	What chance have we got in here ? What are we going to do when they cut .
You 'd better know what you 're doing , or this is going to get very messy .	Don't worry about a thing . I 'll get us going .
We 've got to find Luke .	His fate is sealed . You 'll be lucky to get out yourself . All systems are on alert . everything 's locked .
What 'd you say ?	I didn't say anything ?
I knew that set-up was too good to last . I 'm going to miss it .	Luke !
Luke !	What ?
What ?	Luke needs help . We must go back .
No argument , just do it . That 's a command !	Wait a minute . We 're not going back there .
Someone 's falling .	It 's Luke . Get under him . Slow down . Easy Chewie . Line up your tracking system . Lando , open the hatch .
The deflector shields are gone .	Are the coordinates set ?
I 'm sure my men fixed it . We 've got nothing to worry about .	That sounds familiar .
Nothing more can be done tonight . The shield doors must be closed . I can't wait any longer . I 'm sorry .	I understand .
The speeders should be ready in the morning . They 'll make the search easier .	Is there any chance of them surviving out there ?
Is there any chance of them surviving out there ?	Slim , but yes , there 's a chance . They have a shelter . It 's not much , but .
Have they analyzed the one that was killed ?	Not yet . They 're working on it now .
We 've picked up something outside the base in zone one , moving East .	What is it ?
Two transports at a time is awfully risky .	We have no choice . Send them up . and start clearing everyone out .
You rest now .	So much has happened during the period of your indisposition , sir .
So much has happened during the period of your indisposition , sir .	I 'll be back later .
You don't have to do this to impress me .	If I might remind you , sir , the probability of successfully navi- gating through an asteroid field is approximately 365,000 to one . a graceful surrender might not be .
Closer ?!	Closer ?!
A tremor !	Sir , it 's very possible this asteroid is not stable .
What ?	Oh my , no !
Sir , we 've lost the rear deflector shield . One more direct hit on the back quarter and we 're done for .	Well , what now ?
Rather touchy , aren't they .	I thought you knew this person .
Artoo , you did it ! I never doubted you for a second .	Let 's go .
The Bacta are growing well . The scars should be gone in a day or so . Does it still hurt ?	I 'm fine . Really . Leia . when I was out there and it looked pretty bad . well , it made me think about things .
I 'm fine . Really . Leia . when I was out there and it looked pretty bad . well , it made me think about things .	Me too . I was afraid .
Leia . What would you think if I went away for a while ?	What did you say ?!
Where are you going ?	I have this . feeling . I 'm not sure , really .
I have this . feeling . I 'm not sure , really .	That 's just great . Why doesn't everyone just take off ?
That 's just great . Why doesn't everyone just take off ?	What are you talking about ?
What are you talking about ?	First Han , now you . When am I going to learn not to count on anyone but myself ? .
First Han , now you . When am I going to learn not to count on anyone but myself ? .	Han 's leaving ?
Calm down , will ya ? Tell me about Han .	He wants to pay off that criminal he 's in hock to .
He wants to pay off that criminal he 's in hock to .	Jabba the Hutt ?
Jabba the Hutt ?	I could get more loyalty if I went down the hall and recruited some of those snow creatures .
I could get more loyalty if I went down the hall and recruited some of those snow creatures .	Snow creatures . they 're here ?!
Leia !	Luke , no ! It 's a trap .
Lando , is he alright ? . Lando ? Are you there ? How 's Luke ?	He 'll survive .
This hyperdrive had better work .	I 've never seen it fail .
Ready are you ? What know you of ready ? I have trained Jedi for 800 years . My own counsel I 'll keep on who is to be trained .	Why not me ?
Why not me ?	To become a Jedi takes the deepest commitment , the most serious mind .
I have followed my feelings .	You are reckless !
I will not fail you . I 'm not afraid .	You will be , my young one . Heh . You will be .
It would be in seven pieces , were you a Jedi .	I thought I was in good shape .
I thought I was in good shape .	Yes , but by what standard , ask I ? Forget your old measures . Unlearn , heh , unlearn .
Master , moving rocks is one thing , but this is a little different .	No ! No different ! The differences are in your mind . Throw them out ! No longer of use are they to you .
No ! No different ! The differences are in your mind . Throw them out ! No longer of use are they to you .	Okay . I 'll give it a try .
Okay . I 'll give it a try .	No . Try not . Do , do . Or do not . There is no try .
I can't . It 's too big .	Size has no meaning . It matters not . Look at me . Judge me by my size do you ?
I don't believe it .	That is why you fail .
Concentration . Heh ? Concentration .	I thought those seekers were set for stun !
I thought those seekers were set for stun !	That they are .
That they are .	They 're a lot stronger than I 'm used to .
They 're a lot stronger than I 'm used to .	That would matter not were The Force flowing through you . Higher you 'd jump ! Faster you 'd move ! Open yourself to The Force you must .
No , no . This will not do . Anger is what you feel .	But I feel The Force flowing !
But I feel The Force flowing !	Anger , fear , aggression ! The dark side of The Force are they . Easily they flow . quick to join you in a fight . Beware , beware , beware of them . A heavy price is paid for the power they bring .
Price ? What do you mean ?	The dark side beckons . But if once start down the dark path , forever will it dominate your destiny . Consume you it will . as it did wan 's apprentice .
The dark side beckons . But if once start down the dark path , forever will it dominate your destiny . Consume you it will . as it did wan 's apprentice .	Lord Vader . Is the dark side stronger ?
Lord Vader . Is the dark side stronger ?	No , no . Easier , quicker , more seductive .
No , no . Easier , quicker , more seductive .	But how am I to know the good side from the dark ?
But how am I to know the good side from the dark ?	You will know . When you are at peace . calm . passive . A Jedi uses The Force for knowledge and defense . Never for attack .
You will know . When you are at peace . calm . passive . A Jedi uses The Force for knowledge and defense . Never for attack .	But tell me why .
But tell me why .	No ! Nothing more will I tell you now . Clear your mind of questions . Quiet now be . at peace .
Four this time ! The Force you feel .	Yes . I also feel danger . death . Something 's not right .
I feel cold .	This tree is strong with the dark side of The Force . A servant of evil it is . Into it you must go .
This tree is strong with the dark side of The Force . A servant of evil it is . Into it you must go .	What 's in there ?
What 's in there ?	Only what you take with you .
Ben ? Ben ?	Free your mind and return he will .
Free your mind and return he will .	My mind fills with so many images .
My mind fills with so many images .	Control , control you must learn of what you see . Not easy , not fast .
Control , control you must learn of what you see . Not easy , not fast .	I see a city in the clouds .
I see a city in the clouds .	Bespin . I see it too . Friends you have there , heh ? Concentrate and see them you will .
Bespin . I see it too . Friends you have there , heh ? Concentrate and see them you will .	I see them ! . They 're in pain . they 're suffering .
I see them ! . They 're in pain . they 're suffering .	It is the future you see .
Will they die ?	Difficult to see . Always in motion is the future . Back away , little machine !
They 're my friends .	Foreknowledge is helpful , but painful sometimes and dangerous too . You have far to go in your training .
Yes , yes . To Obi-wan you listen young one . The tree . Remember your failure at the tree ! Heh ?	I 've learned so much since then . And I 'll return to finish . I promise that , master .
And sacrifice Han and Leia ?	If it must be . Yes .
The fear does not reach you . You have learned more than I anticipated .	You 'll find I 'm full of surprises .
You 'll find I 'm full of surprises .	And I too .
Your future lies with us , Skywalker . Now you will embrace the dark side . Obi-wan knew this to be true .	No !
No !	There is much Obi-wan did not tell you . Come , The Emperor will complete your training .
There is much Obi-wan did not tell you . Come , The Emperor will complete your training .	I 'll die first .
I 'll die first .	That won't be necessary .
All too easy . Perhaps you are not as strong as The Emperor thought .	Time will tell .
The Force runs strong in the Skywalker line . You will achieve great power . Come , join with me ! Together we will be the most powerful . even stronger than The Emperor .	No ! . Never .
There is no escape . You must join me or die . Don't make me destroy you here . The Emperor is strong with The Force . But if you join me , together we could overthrow Him . Do not resist . It is our destiny !	Never .
The Hoth System ?	Yes , Sir . we have visuals . the System is supposed to be devoid of human forms .
Yes , My Lord .	Make ready to land General Veers ' assault troops on the surface . Then deploy the fleet so that nothing can get off that system . You 're in command now , Admiral Piett .
Seventeen ships destroyed , we don't know how many got away .	Anything on the Millennium Falcon ?
Anything on the Millennium Falcon ?	It won't get through the blockade .
It won't get through the blockade .	I want that ship .
Admiral , we 're in position . All fighters accounted for .	Proceed with the countdown . All groups assume attack coordinates .
All craft , prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark .	All right . Stand by .
We saw it . All craft prepare to retreat .	You won't get another chance at this , Admiral .
You won't get another chance at this , Admiral .	We have no choice , General Calrissian . Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude .
We have no choice , General Calrissian . Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude .	Han will have that shield down . We 've got to give him more time .
At that close range , we won't last long against those Star Destroyers .	We 'll last longer then we will against that Death Star . and we might just take a few of them with us .
The shield is down ! Commence attack on theDeath Star 's main reactor .	We 're on our way . Red Group , Gold Group , all fighters follow me . Told you they 'd do it !
I can't do it , Artoo . I can't go on alone .	Yoda will always be with you .
You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father .	You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force . He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader . When that happened , the good man who was your father was destroyed . So what I have told you was true . from a certain point of view .
There 's still good in him .	I also thought he could be turned back to the good side . It couldn't be done . He is more machine now than man . Twisted and evil .
I also thought he could be turned back to the good side . It couldn't be done . He is more machine now than man . Twisted and evil .	I can't do it , Ben .
I can't do it , Ben .	You cannot escape your destiny .
You cannot escape your destiny .	I tried to stop him once . I couldn't do it .
I tried to stop him once . I couldn't do it .	Vader humbled you when first you met him , Luke . but that experience was part of your training . It taught you , among other things , the value of patience . Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then , you could have finished your training here with Yoda . You would have been prepared .
Vader humbled you when first you met him , Luke . but that experience was part of your training . It taught you , among other things , the value of patience . Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then , you could have finished your training here with Yoda . You would have been prepared .	But I had to help my friends .
To be a Jedi , Luke , you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn't get past . Impatience is the easiest door - for you , like your father . Only , your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door , and you have held firm . You 're no longer so reckless now , Luke . You are strong and patient . And now , you must face Darth Vader again !	I can't kill my own father .
I can't kill my own father .	Then the Emperor has already won . You were our only hope .
Then the Emperor has already won . You were our only hope .	Yoda spoke of another .
Yoda spoke of another .	The other he spoke of is your twin sister .
The other he spoke of is your twin sister .	But I have no sister .
But I have no sister .	Hmm . To protect you both from the Emperor , you were hidden from your father when you were born . The Emperor knew , as I did , if Anakin were to have any offspring , they would be a threat to him . That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous .
Hmm . To protect you both from the Emperor , you were hidden from your father when you were born . The Emperor knew , as I did , if Anakin were to have any offspring , they would be a threat to him . That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous .	Leia ! Leia 's my sister .
Leia ! Leia 's my sister .	Your insight serves you well . Bury your feelings deep down , Luke . They do you credit . But they could be made to serve the Emperor .
But you can't let her get involved now , Ben . Vader will destroy her .	She hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have , Luke . but the Force is strong with her , as it is with all of your family . There is no avoiding the battle . You must face and destroy Vader !
Shhh . You have hibernation sickness .	I can't see .
I can't see .	Your eyesight will return in time .
Your eyesight will return in time .	Where am I ?
Where am I ?	Jabba 's palace .
Jabba 's palace .	Who are you ?
The Death Star will be completed on schedule .	You have done well , Lord Vader . And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker .
You have done well , Lord Vader . And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker .	Yes , my Master .
Yes , my Master .	Patience , my friend . In time he will seek you out . And when he does , you must bring him before me . He has grown strong . Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force .
Patience , my friend . In time he will seek you out . And when he does , you must bring him before me . He has grown strong . Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force .	As you wish .
As you wish .	Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen .
What is thy bidding , my Master ?	Send the fleet to the far side of Endor . There it will stay until called for .
Send the fleet to the far side of Endor . There it will stay until called for .	What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust ?
What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust ?	It is of no concern . Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us ! Your work here is finished , my friend . Go out to the command ship and await my orders .
It is of no concern . Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us ! Your work here is finished , my friend . Go out to the command ship and await my orders .	Yes , my Master .
I told you to remain on the command ship .	A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor .
I have felt him , my Master .	Strange , that I have not . I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear , Lord Vader .
They are clear , my Master .	Then you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them .
Oh , no , my young Jedi . You will find that it is you who are mistaken . about a great many things .	His lightsaber .
Han !	Luke !
Luke !	Are you all right ?
Are you all right ?	Fine . Together again , huh ?
Fine . Together again , huh ?	Wouldn't miss it .
Wouldn't miss it .	How are we doing ?
How are we doing ?	The same as always .
The same as always .	That bad , huh ? Where 's Leia ?
I think my eyes are getting better . Instead of a big dark blur , I see a big light blur .	There 's nothing to see . I used to live here , you know .
There 's nothing to see . I used to live here , you know .	You 're gonna die here , you know . Convenient .
You 're gonna die here , you know . Convenient .	Just stick close to Chewie and Lando . I 've taken care of everything .
Just stick close to Chewie and Lando . I 've taken care of everything .	Oh . great !
Why don't you leave that crate and come with us ?	I have a promise I have to keep first . to an old friend .
Luke .	Hi , Han . Chewie .
You got her warmed ?	Yeah , she 's comin ' up .
Right . Chewie , let 's see what this piece of junk can do . Ready , everybody ?	All set .
Vader 's on that ship .	Now don't get jittery , Luke . There are a lot of command ships . Keep your distance though , Chewie , but don't look like you 're trying to keep your distance .
I don't know . Fly casual .	I 'm endangering the mission . I shouldn't have come .
I 'm endangering the mission . I shouldn't have come .	It 's your imagination , kid . Come on . Let 's keep a little optimism here .
Chewie and I will take care of this . You stay here .	Quietly , there might be more of them out there .
I thought she was with you .	We got separated .
Take the squad ahead . We 'll meet at the shield generator at 0300 .	Come on , Artoo . We 'll need your scanners .
Nice work . Great , Chewie ! Great ! Always thinking with your stomach .	Will you take it easy ? Let 's just figure out a way to get out of this thing . Han , can you reach my lightsaber ?
Will you take it easy ? Let 's just figure out a way to get out of this thing . Han , can you reach my lightsaber ?	Yeah , sure .
Hey !	Han , don't . It 'll be all right .
Somehow , I got the feeling that didn't help us very much .	Threepio , tell them if they don't do as you wish , you 'll become angry and use your magic .
Someone who loves you .	Leia !
Leia !	I gotta get you out of here .
I don't know . All I can see is a lot of blowing sand !	That 's all any of us can see .
Hey , are you awake ?	Yeah , I just got a funny feeling . Like I 'm not gonna see her again .
Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid .	It 'll work . It 'll work .
Shall we try and go around ?	It 'll take time . This whole party 'll be for nothing if they see us .
What 's going on ?	I don't know .
I .	Ahhh .
I 'm sorry .	Hold me .
The main entrance to the control bunker 's on the far side of that landing platform . This isn't gonna be easy .	Hey , don't worry . Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this .
Han ! Hurry ! The fleet will be here any moment .	Charges ! Come on , come on !
The code 's changed . We need Artoo !	Here 's the terminal .
I 'm sure Luke wasn't on that thing when it blew .	He wasn't . I can feel it .
He wasn't . I can feel it .	You love him , don't you ?
Yes .	All right . I understand . Fine . When he comes back , I won't get in the way .
Han ! Chewie ?	Lando !
Lando , grab it !	Lower it !
Lower it !	I 'm trying !
Chewie ! Chewie , give me the gun . Don't move , Lando .	No , wait ! I thought you were blind !
No , wait ! I thought you were blind !	It 's all right . Trust me . Don't move .
It 's all right . Trust me . Don't move .	All right ! A little higher ! Just a little higher !
Guess I owe you some thanks , too , Lando .	Figured if I left you frozen like that you 'd just give me bad luck the rest of my life , so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later .
Well , look at you , a general , huh ?	Oh , well , someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab .
Look . I want you to take her . I mean it . Take her . You need all the help you can get . She 's the fastest ship in the fleet .	All right , old buddy . You know , I know what she means to you . I 'll take good care of her . She-she won't get a scratch . All right ?
Good luck .	You , too .
Oh , dear . His High Exaltedness , the great Jabba the Hutt , has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately .	Good , I hate long waits .
Good , I hate long waits .	You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of Carkoon , the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc .
In his belly , you will find a new definition of pain and suffering , as you are slowly digested over a thousand years .	On second thought , let 's pass on that , huh ?
Here we go again .	All right , hang on .
What are you telling them ?	Hello , I think . I could be mistaken . They 're using a very primitive dialect . But I do believe they think I am some sort of god .
Well , why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this ?	I beg your pardon , General Solo , but that just wouldn't be proper .
I beg your pardon , General Solo , but that just wouldn't be proper .	Proper ?!
Proper ?!	It 's against my programming to impersonate a deity .
What did he say ?	I 'm rather embarrassed , General Solo , but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor .
We 're coming !	Come on ! Come on !
Come on ! Come on !	Oh , Artoo , hurry !
My goodness ! Artoo , why did you have to be so brave ?	Well , I suppose I could hotwire this thing .
Oh , Princess Leia , are you all right ?	Let 's see .
Lord Vader , this is an unexpected pleasure . We 're honored by your presence .	You may dispense with the pleasantries , Commander . I 'm here to put you back on schedule .
I assure you , Lord Vader , my men are working as fast as they can .	Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them .
Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them .	I tell you , this station will be operational as planned .
I tell you , this station will be operational as planned .	The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation .
The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation .	But he asks the impossible . I need more men .
But he asks the impossible . I need more men .	Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives .
That is correct , Commander . And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress .	We shall double our efforts .
We shall double our efforts .	I hope so , Commander , for your sake . The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am .
All wings report in .	Red Leader standing by .
Good shot , Red Two .	Now . come on , Han , old buddy . Don't let me down .
I 'm going in .	Here goes nothing .
Now lock onto the strongest power source . It should be the power generator .	Form up . And stay alert . We could run out of space real fast .
There it is !	All right , Wedge . Go for the power regulator on the north tower .
All right , Wedge . Go for the power regulator on the north tower .	Copy , Gold Leader . I 'm already on my way out .
Ugh !	Ohhh , I can't bear to watch .
Oh !	Your Royal Highness .
What 's he saying ?	He says there 's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge .
Oh ! Oh , my . Uh , Princess Leia !	Quiet .
Quiet .	I 'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash .
I 'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash .	Oh , no .
Over there ! Two more of them !	I see them . Wait , Leia !
Leia . do you remember your mother ? Your real mother ?	Just a little bit . She died when I was very young .
Just a little bit . She died when I was very young .	What do you remember ?
What do you remember ?	Just . images , really . Feelings .
Just . images , really . Feelings .	Tell me .
Tell me .	She was very beautiful . Kind , but . sad . Why are you asking me all this ?
I have no memory of my mother . I never knew her .	Luke , tell me . What 's troubling you ?
Luke , tell me . What 's troubling you ?	Vader is here . now , on this moon .
He 's my father .	Your father ?
Your father ?	There 's more . It won't be easy for you to hear it , but you must . If I don't make it back , you 're the only hope for the Alliance .
Luke , don't talk that way . You have a power I-I don't understand and could never have .	You 're wrong , Leia . You have that power too . In time you 'll learn to use it as I have . The Force is strong in my family . My father has it . I have it.and.my sister has it .
Yes . It 's you Leia .	I know . Somehow . I 've always known .
I know . Somehow . I 've always known .	Then you know why I have to face him .
Then you know why I have to face him .	No ! Luke , run away , far away . If he can feel your presence , then leave this place . I wish I could go with you .
No ! Luke , run away , far away . If he can feel your presence , then leave this place . I wish I could go with you .	No , you don't . You 've always been strong .
No , you don't . You 've always been strong .	But , why must you confront him ?
But , why must you confront him ?	Because . there is good in him . I 've felt it . He won't turn me over to the Emperor . I can save him . I can turn him back to the good side . I have to try .
The Emperor has been expecting you .	I know , father .
I know , father .	So , you have accepted the truth .
Come with me .	Obi-Wan once thought as you do .
You don't know the power of the dark side . I must obey my master .	I will not turn . and you 'll be forced to kill me .
I will not turn . and you 'll be forced to kill me .	If that is your destiny .
If that is your destiny .	Search your feelings , father . You can't do this . I feel the conflict within you . Let go of your hate .
Search your feelings , father . You can't do this . I feel the conflict within you . Let go of your hate .	It is too late for me , son . The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force . He is your master now .
Obi-Wan has taught you well .	I will not fight you , father .
Your thoughts betray you , father . I feel the good in you . the conflict .	There is no conflict .
There is no conflict .	You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before , and I don't believe you 'll destroy me now .
You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before , and I don't believe you 'll destroy me now .	You underestimate the power of the dark side . If you will not fight , then you will meet your destiny .
You cannot hide forever , Luke .	I will not fight you .
I will not fight you .	Give yourself to the dark side . It is the only way you can save your friends . Yes , your thoughts betray you . Your feelings for them are strong . Especially for .
Sister ! So . you have a twin sister . Your feelings have now betrayed her , too . Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me . Now his failure is complete . If you will not turn to the dark side , then perhaps she will .	Never-r-r !
Master Yoda , you can't die .	Strong am I with the Force . but not that strong ! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall . That is the way of things . the way of the Force .
Strong am I with the Force . but not that strong ! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall . That is the way of things . the way of the Force .	But I need your help . I 've come back to complete the training .
But I need your help . I 've come back to complete the training .	No more training do you require . Already know you that which you need .
Yoda , I must know .	Your father he is .
Told you , did he ?	Yes .
Unexpected this is , and unfortunate .	Unfortunate that I know the truth ?
Well , I 'm sorry .	Remember , a Jedi 's strength flows from the Force . But beware . Anger , fear , aggression . The dark side are they . Once you start down the dark path , forever will it dominate your destiny .
Ah , good . New acquisitions . You are a protocol droid , are you not ?	I am See-Threepio , human-cy .
I am See-Threepio , human-cy .	Yes or no will do .
Yes or no will do .	Oh . Well , yes .
Oh . Well , yes .	How many languages do you speak ?
How many languages do you speak ?	I am fluent in over six million forms of communication , and can readily .
I am fluent in over six million forms of communication , and can readily .	Splendid ! We have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him .
Splendid ! We have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him .	Disintegrated ?
