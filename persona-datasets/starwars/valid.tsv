It was . the Emperor .	The Emperor ?
The Emperor ?	Yes , he commands you make contact with him .
Yes , he commands you make contact with him .	Move this ship out of the asteroid field and into a position where we can send a clear transmission .
Move this ship out of the asteroid field and into a position where we can send a clear transmission .	Yes , My Lord .
Yes , My Lord .	And code the signal to my private chamber .
My lord .	Come in , Admiral .
Our pursuit ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon , My Lord . It has entered an asteroid field .	Asteroids don't concern me , Admiral . I want that ship , not excuses . How long until you can have Skywalker and the others in the Millennium Falcon before me ?
Asteroids don't concern me , Admiral . I want that ship , not excuses . How long until you can have Skywalker and the others in the Millennium Falcon before me ?	Soon , Lord Vader .
Soon , Lord Vader .	Yes , Admiral . soon .
Lord Vader , our ships have completed their scan of the area and found nothing . The Millennium Falcon definitely went into lightspeed . It 's probably on the other side of the galaxy by now .	Alert all commands . Calculate every possible destination along their last known trajectory and disburse the fleet to search for them . Don't fail me again , Admiral , I 've had quite enough !
Alert all commands . Calculate every possible destination along their last known trajectory and disburse the fleet to search for them . Don't fail me again , Admiral , I 've had quite enough !	Yes , My Lord . We 'll find them .
He will learn patience .	Much anger in him , like in his father .
Much anger in him , like in his father .	We 've discussed this before .
He can do it .	This one I have watched a long time . All his life has he looked away . to the horizon , to the sky , to the future . Never his mind on where he was , on what he was doing . Adventure , excitement . A Jedi craves not these things !
He 'll learn .	He 's too old . Yes . Too old to start the training .
Will he finish what he begins ?	We 've come this far . He is our only hope .
Stopped they must be . Do you hear ? On this all depends .	You are the last Jedi , Luke . You are our only hope . Be patient .
Luke , use The Force only for knowledge and for defense , not as a weapon . Don't give in to hate or anger or fear . they lead the way to the dark side . Luke nods and climbs back into his ship .	Strong is Vader . Clouded is your fate . Mind what you have learned . Notice everything , everything ! It can save you .
Told you , I did . Reckless is he . Now things are going to worse .	The boy is our last hope .
The boy is our last hope .	No . there is another .
I can't .	You must . Luke , look at me !
You must survive , Luke .	I 'm cold . so cold .
I 'm cold . so cold .	You must go to the Dagobah System . There you will learn from one who taught me : Yoda , the Jedi Master .
You must go to the Dagobah System . There you will learn from one who taught me : Yoda , the Jedi Master .	Ben . Ben .
Ben . Ben .	Luke . you are the only hope .
. Luke , you must not go .	But Han and Leia will surely die .
But Han and Leia will surely die .	You don't know that . Even I cannot see their fate .
You don't know that . Even I cannot see their fate .	I can help them !
I can help them !	You 're not ready yet . You still have much to learn .
You 're not ready yet . You still have much to learn .	I feel The Force .
I feel The Force .	But you cannot control it . This is a dangerous time for you , Luke . You are now most susceptible to the temptations of the dark side .
Will you ? You underestimate The Emperor . It is you he wants . that is why your friends suffer .	And that is why I must go .
And that is why I must go .	Luke , I will not lose you to the Emperor , as I lost Vader .
Luke , I will not lose you to the Emperor , as I lost Vader .	You won't .
You won't .	Only a fully trained Jedi Knight , with The Force as his ally , will conquer Vader and his Emperor . If you end your training now , if you choose the quick and easy path . as Vader did . you will become an agent of evil . and the galaxy will be plunged deeper into the abyss of hate , despair and pain that you feel your friends suffering now .
How you doing , Chewbacca ? Still wasting your time with this clown , eh ?	Growls a reserved greeting .
Growls a reserved greeting .	Right .
Barks at the mention of food . Licks his lips .	Everyone 's invited , of course .
Barks a blue streak .	What 's wrong with him ?
Three patrol ships are heading our way .	Barks an argument and shakes his head .
Turns on Lando , the newcomer , with an ominous growl .	Okay , okay .
Howls .	We 're not out of this yet .
Well , it 's been awhile .	Barks and growls at his boss .
Barks and growls at his boss .	That was a long time ago . I 'm sure he 's forgotten all about it , and so should you .
Howls and shrugs his shoulders .	Why don't we just turn him over to Lando to fix ?
Barks at Han .	Not now , Chewie . Lando , aren't you afraid the Empire might discover this little operation and shut you down ?
Barks his concern .	No , I 'm alright . I 'm alright .
Barks a doleful farewell .	I 'm sure I 'll see you again , too . Keep well . You 'd better chain him until it 's over .
Barks at his master .	What happened ?
We should have stayed and finished them off .	Barks his agreement .
I don't care . It would 've been worth it . for Han .	Barks his right on !
. the power ?	Howls .
Barks his consternation .	Chewie , head for the bottom of the city .
Okay , Chewie , it 's now or never .	Barks his agreement .
