I arise today to speak on a matter of vital importance to the security of the United States and the entire free world .
It is my firm opinion that the expenditure and distribution of the funds , equipment , materials , and service authorized under this bill on behalf of the Associated States of Cambodia , Laos , and Viet-Nam should be administered in such a way as to encourage through all available means the freedom and independence desired by the peoples of the Associated States , including the intensification of the military training of the Vietnamese .
I say that because it is my opinion , based upon the evidence of the accords and treaties that bind the Associated States to the French Union , that genuine independence as we understand it is lacking in this area-that local government is circumscribed in its functions-that the Government of Viet-Nam , the state of which is of the greatest importance in this area , lacks popular suppor t-t hat the degree of military , civil , political , and economic control maintained by the French goes well beyond what is necessary to fight a war .
These are harsh words to say about an ancient friend and ally , France .
They are particularly hard to say because , during a visit to Indochina over a year ago , I saw something of the burdens that France carries in that area .
The troops she has there are as good as any in the world-certainly the flower of her army-and she has maintained the jungle war against numerous and skillful native armies for a long period .
We are well aware , in addition , that if France were to withdraw her troops today , Communists would overrun not only French Indochina but southeast Asia .
But it is because we want the war to be brought to a successful conclusion that we should insist on genuine independence .
The war has been going on since 1946 . There is evidence that the position of the French is not improving .
Meanwhile the assistance the United States is giving is steadily increasing .
S . 2128 provides $400 million for the procurement of equipment , materials , and services for the forces in Indochina , nearly $25 million for economic and technical assistance while the fighting continues , and a classified amount included under military assistance for the Far East which totals $ 1,081,420,493 .
The total for Indochina alone under all three categories could well exceed $1 billion .
The New York Times has stated that we will be paying at least 40 percent of the cost of the war , and I believe that it will eventually mount up to a great deal more .
Yet regardless of our united effort , it is a truism that the war can never be successful unless numbers of the people of Viet-Nam are won over from their sullen neutrality and open hostility to it and fully support its successful conclusion .
This can never be done unless they are reassured beyond doubt that complete independence will be theirs at the conclusion of the war .
In order to assay the degree of control now possessed by the French , it is necessary to review briefly the history of recent years .
The French won control of free Viet-Nam in 1860 . It became , particularly in its southern province-Cochin China-a source of great wealth to the French until the beginning of the Second World War .
During that period of time , France maintained stringent control over the area : Suffrage and eligibility for office were accorded only to the French-and the Annamites could get citizenship only by an act analogous to naturalization .
In 1937 , for example , there were only 2,555 naturalized French Annamites .
During World War II , after the Japanese assumed control of Indochina , the guerrilla movement against the Japanese in that area was led by Ho Chi Minh , the present leader of the Vietminh forces and a man with a long and intimate association with the Communist movement , but who enjoyed and still enjoys a great prestige among the people of the area for his unrelenting struggle against their traditional masters , the French .
It has been estimated that in 1944 the military commander of the guerrilla forces , Vo Nguyen Giap , now the leader of the Vietminh armies , had over 10,000 men under his command , which became the nucleus of the later Communist armies .
In March 1945 the Japanese officially ended the French administration of Indochina .
Bao Dai , the present emperor , proclaimed the independence of Annam by the consent of the Japanese and eventually gained some degree of control over the entire country of Viet-Nam ,
In August 1945 , at the conclusion of World War II , Ho Chi Minh and his Vietminh supporters declared the independence of the democratic Republic of Viet-Nam .
Bao Dai abdicated and became supreme political adviser to Ho Chi Minh , who was then leading the popular-front movement .
Many people have since argued that Ho Chi Minh was at that time ripe for Titoism if the French had been willing to grant him sufficient political concessions .
It is difficult to be convinced of this , although it is true that in November 1945 he did dissolve the Indochinese Communist Party and took similar conciliatory steps to gain the support of a majority of the people .
But his record as a leading and active world Communist figure argues against this theory of Titoism , and the seizure of control by the Communists in China at a later date would have placed him in a most difficult position if he had attempted to break his ties with Moscow .
At Potsdam it had been decided , as in Korea , that the surrender of the Japanese troops north of the 16th parallel would be accepted by the Chinese , south of the 16th parallel by the Southeast Asia Command under Mountbatten to which was attached a French expeditionary corps which , with the British troops , took control of southern Viet-Nam at the end of 1945 amid scenes of violence .
The basis for negotiation between the French and the Vietminh was laid down in General DeGaulle 's statement of policy of March 24 , 1945 .
In it he provided that the Indochinese federation , composed of five distinct countries-Cochin China , Annam , Tonkin , Cambodia , and Laos-was to have an Indochinese government , presided over by a governor general representing France , and composed of French ministers and Autochthons responsible to them .
This government was to be assisted by an equally mixed assembly , so composed that Annamite countries had a maximum percentage of the seats .
The powers of this assembly were to be limited to voting on the budget , and deliberating law projects prepared by the council of state .
No definition was made of the role to be played by local governments , except to state vaguely that they would be protected and reformed .
These terms were obviously unsatisfactory to the natives who were desirous of complete independence , and the negotiations were fruitless .
Finally , on March 6 , 1946 , an accord was signed which regulated the relationships between the French and Ho Chi Minh , an accord which-in spite of Ho Chi Minh 's personal prestige-was greeted with widespread dissatisfaction by the people , for again it fell far short of their hopes and expectations of independence .
Genuine independence was not promised , nor was the unification of the three provinces of Viet-Nam achieved .
On June 1 , 1946 , the autonomous Republic of Cochin China was proclaimed , but the French High Commissioner remained in complete control .
At Fontainebleau on July 6 of that year , new negotiations were begun between the French and Ho Chi Minh .
France once again refused to give in to Ho 's request that Viet-Nam be permitted to control its own army , that a time limit be set on France 's use of military bases in the area , that Viet-Nam be permitted to exchange diplomatic representatives with other countries , that Viet-Nam have the unlimited right to purchase French enterprises in Viet-Nam , and , finally , that Cochin China be joined with the remainder of the country .
On September 14 , 1946 , Ho Chi Minh signed a Modus Vivendi which further clarified the relationships between the two countries , but which maintained a heavy and substantial degree of French control over the internal and external affairs of Viet-Nam .
Ho Chi Minh , recognizing that the Modus Vivendi fell far short of the people 's expectations , said upon signing it , " I have just signed my own death sentence . "
Thus , in the fall of 1946 , the situation In Viet-Nam continued to deteriorate .
Finally , on December 19 , 1946 , as a result of an outbreak of violence and killing in Hanoi , the war began which has since continued with increasing fury .
Since that date , the French have been faced with the difficult task of achieving the fine balance between giving sufficient liberty to the governments they have supported , in order that these governments might win the devotion of the people , and , at the same time , maintaining the basic French influence and control of the area .
But concessions which the French have made to the successive governments have been considerable and if extended to Ho Chi Minh , or other popular leaders in 1945 and 1946 , might have changed the entire history of that area .
In April 1947 , the Mus mission was sent out as a last attempt to bargain with Ho Chi Minh .
It demanded that the Vietnamese lay down their arms and permit French troops to circulate freely in Vietnamese territory .
Paul Mus , the French leader of the mission , later described the terms as a request , for " guaranties equivalent to surrender . "
Ho 's terms continued the same-the Republic must include Cochin China and must have all other attributes of independence .
In 1948 a government of Emperor Bao Dai , who had left Ho Chi Minh in 1946 , for China , was set up under General Xuan .
The dilemma remained : This government could gain popular support only by securing from the French terms which the French were unwilling to grant Ho ; yet it was valuable to the French only if it did not insist upon obtaining as much as Ho wanted .
On June 5 , 1948 , France sought a way out of this dilemma by stating that " France solemnly recognizes the independence of Viet-Nam .
The independence of Viet-Nam has no other limits than those imposed upon it by adherence to the French Union . "
On May 21 , 1948 , the French Assembly voted to end the colonial status of Cochin China and it was attached to Viet-Nam .
This represented a substantial victory for Bao Dai , and as a result he returned to his country on May 21 , 1949 .
In January 1950 , the accords of March 8 , 1949 , signalized by letters exchanged between Bao Dai and President Auriol of France , were approved by the French Assembly giving Viet-Nam not only unity but " independence within the French Union . "
Unfortunately , to this day " independence within the French Union " represents to the majority of Vietnamese a contradiction in terms .
Many Viet-namese have believed that concessions from the French were gained only as the result of military victories ; that the concessions of 1949 were gained from the French only as the result of Communist victories in China ; and that the concessions gained at the PAU Economic Conference of November 1950 , which I shall mention in a moment , were gained only as the result of military victories of the Vietminh in the fall of 1950 .
These military victories were substantial and represented a major political and military defeat for the French .
Major concessions by the French were still essential if any degree of support was to be achieved by the new government ; for the Vietnamese people continued to be discontented , as shown by the statement of Premier Tran Van Huu , who stated upon returning from France in October 1950 :
Many people are dying every day because Viet-Nam is not given ( real ) independence .
* * * If we had independence , the people would have no reason to fight ; there would be no struggle between Viet-Nam and Viet-Minh .
This statement was particularly forceful , as the Premier was himself a French citizen .
At the PAU Economic Conference , on November 27 , 1950 , the French turned over to Viet-Nam the control of customs , communications , immigration , and foreign-trade regulations .
In addition , they agreed to the creation of a national army without which General LeClerc had earlier declared " there can be no military solution . "
On December 8 , 1950 , a new agreement abrogated the agreement of December 30 , 1949 , and recognized that the native army would technically come under the Emperor and not the French , although the training , equipping , and control was maintained by the French .
Further agreements regulating the relationship between the Associated States and France were reached by the March 8 , 1952 , accords , and at the second meeting of the High Council of the French Union in November 1952 .
This compressed history of the negotiations between France and Viet-Nam , and the negotiations between France and Laos and Cambodia , differing only in detail , is important in that it lays the foundation for the modern relationship which governs the Associated States and France .
I have believed that the successive French grants of limited independence to the people of Viet-Nam have always been too little and too late .
The clearest evidence of this is the success that the Viet-Minh forces are today achieving , and the painfully slow growth in popular support which successive governments of Bao Dai have gained from the people .
Unless the people of this area are assured that they are fighting for their own independence and not for the maintenance of French control when victory is won , all of our military assistance and all of the French sacrifices of their youth and treasure will go for naught .
In a letter to me from the Department of State on May 13 , 1953 it was stated :
France in the accords of March 8 , 1949 , and the subsequent accords of Decerhber 16 , 1950 , had granted such a full measure of control to the 3 states over their own affairs that the point of no return to their former colonial or semicolonial status had been amply passed and these 3 countries became sovereign states .
I believe that a survey of the contractual relationships which presently bind the Associated States and France would indicate stringent limitations upon their status as sovereign states .
A clear statement attesting to this was contained on page 36 of the report of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs on the Mutual Security Act of 1953 , but more detailed evidence can be obtained through published accords and treaties .
It is of basic importance , at a time when we authorize the expenditure of large sums of money so that the war may be brought to a successful conclusion , that we realize that conditions are present in the relationship between France and the Associated States that make it difficult to win the wholehearted support of the natives in the struggle against the Communists .
I strongly believe that the French cannot succeed in their mission in Indochina without giving concessions necessary to make the native army a reliable and crusading force .
Senators may have read recently about the kidnapping of a Viet-Nam Officer Training Corps by a company of Viet-Minh forces about 2 months ago .
The fact is that more than 500 officer candidates were kidnapped , if we can believe the story , by a company of Viet-Minh rebels .
Yet the kidnapped were men upon whom the French expected to rely for leadership in a native army .
At present the French control is extensive and paramount . The Associated States , are " independent within the French Union , " although there is no representative body within Viet-Nam that can ratify the treaty relationships between the two countries .
The organs of the French Union were developed at the conclusion of World War II to insure the continued dominance of Metropolitan France over the other countries of the Union .
For example , the French always have a permanent majority in the High Council of the French Union , the President of France is the President of the Union , and the Government of France guides its actions .
In the assembly of the French Union the control is again rested in the Government of France , and the Assembly can express its opinions only on bills submitted to it by the French Assembly or the governments of the Associated States .
Article 62 of the French Constitution states that-
The members of the Union place in common all their resources to guarantee the defense of the whole Union .
The Government of the Republic-
This refers to the French Republic-
shall coordinate these resources and direct such policies as will prepare and insure this defense .
I believe the comparison which is sometimes made between the French Union and the British commonwealth is an inaccurate one , for the control exercised by the French Government over the activities of the Associated States within the French Union is greater than any that the United Kingdom has exercised since the beginning of the 20th century .
There are other limitations upon Viet-Nam independence as a result of their intimate connection with the French Union .
Their foreign policy must be coordinated with that of France , and the French must give consent to the sending of diplomatic missions to foreign countries , although that consent is almost automatic .
The French control over the military situation , including the native armies of Viet-Nam , is nearly complete .
I quote from a recent letter to me from the Department of State :
United States military mission In Viet-Nam is advisory group primarily engaged in the work of the military assistance program which requires careful coordination on the supply side with the French military authorities .
Our mission has no training or operational functions . In fulfilling its obligations under the military assistance program , the United States Military Advisory Group deals directly with the French military authorities and these in turn deal with the Associated States .
This means that the equipment provided in the bill which we are now considering will be turned over to the French military authorities , who will then arrange for its distribution according to their decision .
Our military advisory group is limited to checking military items supplied by the United States .
The French are granted for a period of time without limit facilities for bases and garrisons .
The Vietnamese Government is obliged to turn to the French whenever it desires to secure foreign counselors and technicians .
As the French did not develop experienced governmental administrators during the period before World War II , this provision has given the French in the past an opportunity to guide to some degree actions within the local governments .
The University of Viet-Nam was jointly established with a French rector installed for a 6-year minimum , and all instruction in the local university must be in French , a move which put the French directly in contact with the training of the intellectual youth of the country .
The French control over the economic life of the country is extensive , and the possession of property belonging to the French cannot be changed without permission of the French .
The French still control the country 's basic resources , transportation , and trade .
In Viet-Nam the French control 66 percent of the rice export trade ; 100 percent of rubber products for export ; practically all export and import businesses , all international shipping and the principal coastal shipping .
In the field of foreign commerce , it is estimated that French control is nearly 100 percent .
France shares the veto right under the PAU agreement on matters affecting French Union export and import trade .
French Union subjects are given special legal exemptions . They are given the privilege of extraterritoriality , and are tried in courts in which French law prevails .
Until peace is restored , the French High Commissioner will continue to exercise powers with respect to the internal security of the associated states .
After the restoration of peace , the French will have a liaison mission " charged with guarding the security of the French Union , in cooperation with the police and sûreté of Viet-Nam , " according to the agreement of December 30 , 1949 .
When Vietnamese taxes affect French Union subjects , there must be consultation with the representatives of the countries concerned before they are imposed .
The degree of French control in Viet-Nam is enhanced , as I have said , by the lack of any popular assembly which represents the will of the people .
Some may feel that this is an injudicious time to discuss this matter-that many in France are tired of the war and would gladly see France pull out and retreat to North Africa .
If the French are asked to give up all they have in Indochina , it is said , will there be anything to hold them there ?
I do not believe that the French are fighting in Indochina wholly for material things .
The war and money alone have already cost them substantially more than their total capital investment .
Men like General De Lattre fought for the honor of France ; and the French now are fighting because they know that if they retreat , all of Southeast Asia will go to the Communists-that their position in North Africa will become endangered and that the security of Metropolitan France itself will be threatened .
Thus they fight on , and deserve our wholehearted support .
But I believe it vital for the cause for which both of us fight that conditions be established there that will make it possible for the French to win-that will rally the support of native elements to take their share of the struggle .
Which , in fact , is more likely to cause the French to withdraw : another season of fruitless and bloody campaigns , or the prospect of eventual victory , even though it means the loss of some of the French states in that area ?
I do not believe there can be any question as to which is the proper course to take .
I believe that men with responsible positions in France know this and are moving in that direction .
I believe it is of the utmost importance at a time when the United States is committing itself deeper and deeper into Indochina , that our influence and prestige with the French be used to promote the independence and well-being of the people of the Associated States .
If we do so , not only would the prospects of victory be substantially enhanced , but the position of the United States and France and of the whole Western alliance in Asia will be materially advanced in Asia .
Congressional Record , April 6 , 1954 , p . 4672
Senator John F . Kennedy , US Senate
Mr. President , the time has come for the American people to be told the blunt truth about Indochina .
I am reluctant to make any statement which may be misinterpreted as unappreciative of the gallant French struggle at Dien Bien Phu and elsewhere ; or as partisan criticism of our Secretary of State just prior to his participation in the delicate deliberations in Geneva .
Nor , as one who is not a member of those committees of the Congress which have been briefed-if not consulted-on this matter , do I wish to appear impetuous or alarmist in my evaluation of the situation .
But the speeches of President Eisenhower , Secretary Dulles , and others have left too much unsaid , in my opinion-and what has been left unsaid is the heart of the problem that should concern every citizen .
For if the American people are , for the fourth time in this century , to travel the long and tortuous road of war particularly a war which we now realize would threaten the survival of civilization , then I believe we have a right-a right which we should have hitherto exercised-to inquire in detail into the nature of the struggle in which we may become engaged , and the alternative to such struggle .
Without such clarification the general support and success of our policy is endangered .
Inasmuch as Secretary Dulles has rejected , with finality , any suggestion of bargaining on Indochina in exchange for recognition of Red China , those discussions in Geneva which concern that war may center around two basic alternatives :
The first is a negotiated peace , based either upon partition of the area between the forces of the Viet Minh and the French Union , possibly along the 16th parallel ; or based upon a coalition government in which Ho Chi Minh is represented .
Despite any wishful thinking to the contrary , it would be apparent that the popularity and prevalence of Ho Chi Minh and his following throughout Indochina would cause either partition or a coalition government to result in eventual domination by the Communists .
The second alternative is for the United States to persuade the French to continue their valiant and costly struggle ; an alternative which , considering the current state of opinion in France , will be adopted only if the United States pledges increasing support .
Secretary Dulles ' statement that the " imposition in southeast Asia of the political system of Communist Russia and its Chinese Communist ally . . . should be met by united action " indicates that it is our policy to give such support , that we will , as observed by the New York Times last Wednesday , " fight if necessary to keep southeast Asia out of their hands " ; and that we hope to win the support of the free countries of Asia for united action against communism in Indochina , in spite of the fact that such nations have pursued since the war 's inception a policy of cold neutrality .
I think it is important that the Senate and the American people demonstrate their endorsement of Mr. Dulles ' objectives despite our difficulty in ascertaining the full significance of its key phrases .
Certainly , I , for one , favor a policy of a " united action " by many nations whenever necessary to achieve a military and political victory for the free world in that area , realizing full well that it may eventually require some commitment of our manpower .
But to pour money , materiel , and men into the jungles of Indochina without at least a remote prospect of victory would be dangerously futile and self-destructive .
Of course , all discussion of " united action " assumes the inevitability of such victory ; but such assumptions are not unlike similar predictions of confidence which have lulled the American people for many years and which , if continued , would present an improper basis for determining the extent of American participation .
Permit me to review briefly some of the statements concerning the progress of the war in that area , and it will be understood why I say that either we have not frankly and fully faced the seriousness of the military situation , or our intelligence estimates and those of the French have been woefully defective .
In February of 1951 , for example , the late Brig .
Gen . Francis G . Brink , then head of the United States Military Advisory Group in Indochina , told us of the favorable turn of events in that area as a result of new tactics designed by Gen . Jean de Lattre de Tassigny .
In the fall of that same year , General De Lattre himself voiced optimism in his speech before the National Press Club here in Washington , and predicted victory , under certain conditions , in 18 months to 2 years , during his visit to France .
In June of 1952 , American and French officials issued a joint communique in Washington expressing the two countries ' joint determination to bring the battle to a successful end ; and Secretary of State Acheson stated at his press conference that-
The military situation appears to be developing favorably . * * * Aggression has been checked and recent indications warrant the view that the tide is now moving in our favor .
* * * We can anticipate continued favorable developments .
In March 1953 , the French officials again came to Washington , again issued statements , predicting , victory in Indochina , and again joined with the United States in a communique planning military action and United States support which would achieve their new goal of decisive military victory in 2 years .
In May of 1953 , President Eisenhower and Secretary of State Dulles told the Congress that our mutual-security program for France , and Indochina , would help " reduce this Communist pressure to manageable proportions . "
In June an American military mission headed by General O'Daniel was sent to discuss with General Navarre in Indochina the manner in which United States aid " may best contribute to the advancement of the objective of defeating the Communist forces there " ; and in the fall of last year General O'Daniel stated that he was " confident that the French-trained Vietnam Army when fully organized would prevail over the rebels . "
In September of 1953 , French and American officials again conferred , and , in announcing a new program of extensive American aid , again issued a communique restating the objective of " an early and victorious conclusion . "
On December 2 , 1953 , Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs Walter S . Robertson told the Women 's National Republican Club in New York-in words almost identical with those of Secretary of State Acheson 18 months earlier-that " In Indochina . .
. we believe the tide now is turning . " Later the same month Secretary of State Dulles stated that military setbacks in the area had been exaggerated ; and that he did not " believe that anything that has happened upsets appreciably the timetable of General Navarre 's plan , " which anticipated decisive military results by about March 1955 .
In February of this year , Defense Secretary Wilson said that a French victory was " both possible and probable " and that the war was going " fully as well as we expected it to at this stage .
I see no reason to think Indochina would be another Korea . "
Also in February of this year , Under Secretary of State Smith stated that :
The military situation in Indochina is favorable . * * *
Contrary to some reports , the recent advances made by the Viet Minh are largely " real estate " operations .
* * * Tactically , the French position is solid and the officers in the field seem confident of their ability to deal with the situation .
Less than 2 weeks ago , Admiral Radford , Chairman of the Joints Chief of Staff , stated that " the French are going to win . "
And finally , in a press conference some days prior to his speech to the Overseas Press Club in New York , Secretary of State Dulles stated that he did not " expect that there is going to be a Communist victory in Indochina " ; that " in terms of Communist domination of Indochina , I do not accept that as a probability " ; that " we have seen no reason to abandon the so-called Navarre plan , " which meant decisive results only 1 year hence ; and that the United States would provide whatever additional equipment was needed for victory over the Viet Minh ; with the upper hand probably to be gained " by the end of the next fightng season . "
Despite this series of optimistic reports about eventual victory , every member of the Senate knows that such victory today appears to be desperately remote , to say the least , despite tremendous amounts of economic and materiel aid from the United States , and despite a deplorable loss of French Union manpower .
The call for either negotiations or additional participation by other nations underscores the remoteness of such a final victory today , regardless of the outcome at Dien Bien Phu .
It is , of course , for these reasons that many French are reluctant to continue the struggle without greater assistance ; for to record the sapping effect which time and the enemy have had on their will and strength in that area is not to disparage their valor .
If " united action " can achieve the necessary victory over the forces of communism , and thus preserve the security and freedom of all Southeast Asia , then such united action is clearly called for .
But if , on the other hand , the increase in our aid and the utilization of our troops would only result in further statements of confidence without ultimate victory over aggression , then now is the time when we must evaluate the conditions under which that pledge is made .
I am frankly of the belief that no amount of American military assistance in Indochina can conquer an enemy which is everywhere and at the same time nowhere , " an enemy of the people " which has the sympathy and covert support of the people .
As succinctly stated by the report of the Judd Subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee in January of this year :
Until political independence has been achieved , an effective fighting force from the associated states cannot be expected .
* * * The apathy of the local population to the menace of Viet Minh communism disguised as nationalism is the most discouraging aspect of the situation .
That can only be overcome through the grant of complete independence to each of the associated states .
Only for such a cause as their own freedom will people make the heroic effort necessary to win this kind of struggle .
This is an analysis which is shared , if in some instances grudgingly , by most American observers .
Moreover , without political independence for the Associated States , the other Asiatic nations have made it clear that they regard this as a war of colonialism ; and the " united action " which is said to be so desperately needed for victory in that area is likely to end up as unilateral action by our own country .
Such intervention , without participation by the armed forces of the other nations of Asia , without the support of the great masses of the people of the Associated States , with increasing reluctance and discouragement on the part of the French-and , I might add , with hordes of Chinese Communist troops poised just across the border in anticipation of our unilateral entry into their kind of battleground-such intervention , Mr. President , would be virtually impossible in the type of military situation which prevails in Indochina .
This is not a new point , of course . In November of 1951 , I reported upon my return from the Far East as follows :
" In Indochina we have allied ourselves to the desperate effort of a French regime to hang on to the remnants of empire .
There is no broad , general support of the native Vietnam government among the people of that area .
To check the southern drive of communism makes sense but not only through reliance on the force of arms .
The task is rather to build strong native non-Communist sentiment within these areas and rely on that as a spearhead of defense rather than upon the legions of General de Lattre .
To do this apart from and in defiance of innately nationalistic aims spells foredoomed failure . "
In June of last year , I sought an amendment to the Mutual Security Act which would have provided for the distribution of American aid , to the extent feasible , in such a way as to encourage the freedom and independence desired by the people of the Associated States My amendment was soundly defeated on the grounds that we should not pressure France into taking action on this delicate situation ; and that the new French government could be expected to make " a decision which would obviate the necessity of this kind of amendment or resolution . "
The distinguished majority leader [ Mr. Knowland ] assured us that " We will all work , in conjunction with our great ally , France , toward the freedom of the people of those states . "
It is true that only 2 days later on July 3 the French Government issued a statement agreeing that-
There is every reason to complete the independence of sovereignty of the Associated States of Indochina by insuring * * * the transfer of the powers * * * retained in the interests of the States themselves , because of the perilous circumstances resulting from the state of war .
In order to implement this agreement , Bao Dai arrived in Paris on August 27 calling for " complete independence for Vietnam . "
I do not wish to weary the Senate with long recital of the proceedings of the negotiations , except to say that as of today they have brought no important change in the treaty relationships between Vietnam and the French Republic .
Today the talks appear to be at an impasse ; and the return from Paris to Saigon of the Premier of Vietnam , Prince Buu Loc , is not a happy augury for their success .
Thus the degree of control which the French retain in the area is approximately the same as I outlined last year :
Politically , French control was and is extensive and paramount .
There is no popular assembly in Vietnam which represents the will of the people that can ratify the treaty relationship between Vietnam and the French .
Although the Associated States are said to be " independent within the French Union , " the French always have a permanent control in the high council and in the Assembly of the Union and the Government of France guides its actions .
Under article 62 of the French Constitution , the French Government " coordinates " all the resources of the members of the Union placed in common to guarantee its defense , under policies directed and prepared by the French Government .
French Union subjects are given special legal exemptions , including the privilege of extraterritoriality .
The French High Commissioner continues to exercise powers with respect to the internal security of the Associated States , and will have a similar mission even after the restoration of peace .
When Vietnamese taxes affect French Union subjects , there must be consultation with the representatives of the countries concerned before they are imposed .
The foreign-policy of Vietnam must be coordinated with that of France , and the French must give consent to the sending of diplomatic missions to foreign countries .
Inasmuch as the French did not develop experienced governmental administrators before World War II , they have guided to some degree actions within the local governments by requiring the Vietnamese Government to turn to them for foreign counselors and technicians .
Militarily , French control is nearly complete . The United States has in the past dealt primarily with the French military authority , and these in turn deal with the Associated States .
Our equipment and aid is turned over to the French who will then arrange for its distribution according to their decision .
The French are granted for a period of time without limit facilities for bases and garrisons .
Culturally , the French are directly in contact with the training of intellectual youths of Vietnam , inasmuch as France joined in the establishment of the university , installed a French rector , and provided that all instructions should be in French .
Economically , French control of the country 's basic resources , transportation , trade , and economic life in general is extensive .
In Vietnam , estimated French control is nearly 100 percent in the field of foreign commerce , international and coastal shipping , and rubber and other export products .
The French control 66 percent of the rice export , trade .
Moreover , possession of property belonging to the French cannot be changed without permission of the French ; and France shares the veto right under the PAU agreement on matters affecting France 's export and import trade .
All of this flies in the face of repeated assurances to the American people by our own officials that complete independence has been or will be granted .
In February of 1951 , for example , the American Minister to the Associated States , Donald Heath , told us that the French colonial regime had ended and that " all Indochinese Government services were turned over to the Indochinese States .
" This is untrue . In November of 1951 , Assistant Secretary of State Dean Rusk again assured us that-
The peoples of the Associated States are free to assume the expensive responsibility for their own affairs that has been accorded them by treaties with France .
Last year , the Department of State assured me that-
France had granted such a full measure of control to the 3 states over their own affairs that these 3 countries became sovereign states .
In February of this year , Under Secretary of State Smith stated that the .
representatives of the Government of Vietnam and of France would " meet in Paris to draw up the treaty which will complete Vietnamese independence .
" As I have said , those conversations began in July , and broke off 10 days ago .
And again Secretary Dulles stated last week that-
Their independence is not yet complete , but the French Government last July declared its intention to complete that independence , and negotiations to consummate that pledge are underway .
They are underway 9 months after the pledge was originally given .
I do not believe that the importance of the current breakdown of these negotiations has been made clear to the Senate or the People of the United States .
Every year we are given three sets of assurances : First , that the independence of the Associated States is now complete ; second , that the independence of the Associated States will soon be completed under steps " now " being undertaken ; and , third , that military victory for the French Union forces in Indochina is assured , or is just around the corner , or lies two years off .
But the stringent limitations upon the status of the Associated States as sovereign states remain ; and the fact that military victory has not yet been achieved is largely the result of these limitations .
Repeated failure of these prophecies has , however , in no way diminished the frequency of their reiteration , and they have caused this nation to delay definitive action until now the opportunity for any desirable solution may well be past .
It is time , therefore , for us to face the stark reality of the difficult situation before us without the false hopes which predictions of military victory and assurances of complete independence have given us in the past .
The hard truth of the matter is , first , that without the wholehearted support of the peoples of the Associated States , without a reliable and crusading native army with a dependable officer corps , a military victory , even with American support , in that area is difficult if not impossible , of achievement ; and , second , that the support of the people of that area cannot be obtained without a change in the contractual relationships which presently exist between the Associated States and the French Union .
Instead of approaching a solution to this problem , as Secretary Dulles indicated , French and Vietnamese officials appear to be receding from it .
The Vietnamese , whose own representatives lack full popular support , because of a lack of popular assembly in that country , recognizing that French opinion favoring a military withdrawal would become overwhelming if all ties were entirely broken , have sought 2 treaties : one giving the Vietnamese complete and genuine independence , and the other maintaining a tie with the French Union on the basis of equality , as in the British commonwealth .
But 9 months of negotiations have failed thus far to provide a formula for both independence and union which is acceptable to the parties currently in the government of each nation .
The French Assembly on March 9-and I believe this action did not receive the attention it deserved-substantially lessened the chances of such a solution , though the adoption of a tremendously far-reaching rider which declared that France would consider her obligations toward Indochinese states ended if they should revoke the clauses in the French Constitution that bind them to the French Union .
In other words , Mr. President , the French Parliament indicated that France would no longer have any obligations toward the Associated States if the present ties which bind them to the French Union-ties which assure , because of the constitutional arrangement of the French Union , that the French Republic and its Government are always the dominant power in the union-were broken .
I realize that Secretary Dulles cannot force the French to adopt any course of action to which they are opposed ; nor am I unaware of the likelihood of a French military withdrawal from Indochina , once its political and economic stake in that area is gone .
But we must realize that the difficulties in the military situation which would result from French withdrawal would not be greatly different from the difficulties which would prevail after the intervention of American troops without the support of the Indochinese or the other nations of Asia .
The situation might be compared to what the situation would have been In Korea , if the Japanese had maintained possession of Korea , if a Communist group of Koreans were carrying on a war there with Japan-which had dominated that area for more than a century-and if we then went to the assistance of the Japanese , and put down the revolution of the native Koreans , even though they were Communists , and even though in taking that action we could not have the support of the non-Communist elements of the country .
That is the type of situation , whether we like it or not , which is presented today in connection with our support of the French in Indochina , without the support of the native peoples of Indochina .
In Indochina , as in Korea , the battle against communism should be a battle , not for economic or political gain , but for the security of the free world , and for the values and institutions which are held dear-in France and throughout the non-Communist world , as well as in the United States .
It seems to me , therefore , that the dilemma which confronts us is not a hopeless one ; that a victorious fight can be maintained by the French , with the support of this Nation and many other nations-and most important of all , the support of the Vietnamese and other peoples of the Associated States-once it is recognized that the defense of southeast Asia and the repelling of Communist aggression are the objectives of such a struggle , and not the maintenance of political relationships founded upon ancient colonialism .
In such a struggle , the United States and other nations may properly be called upon to play their fullest part .
If , however , this is not to be the nature of the war ; if the French persist in their refusal to grant the legitimate independence and freedom desired by the peoples of the Associated States ; and if those peoples and the other peoples of Asia remain aloof from the conflict , as they , have in the past , then it is my hope that Secretary Dulles , before pledging our assistance at Geneva , will recognize the futility of channeling American men and machines into that hopeless internecine struggle .
The facts and alternatives before us are unpleasant , Mr. President .
But in a nation such as ours , it is only through the fullest and frankest appreciation of such facts and alternatives that any foreign policy can be effectively maintained .
In an era of supersonic attack and atomic retaliation , extended public debate and education are of no avail , once such a policy must be implemented .
The time to study , to doubt , to review , and revise is now , for upon our decisions now may well rest the peace and security of the world , and , indeed , the very continued existence of mankind .
And if we cannot entrust this decision to the people , then , as Thomas Jefferson once said : " If we think them not enlightened enough to exercise their control with a wholesome discretion , the remedy is not to take it from them but to inform their discretion by education . "
WHAT IS A LIBERAL ?
Sen. John F . Kennedy , acceptance of the New York Liberal Party Nomination , September 14 , 1960 :
What do our opponents mean when they apply to us the label " Liberal ?
" If by " Liberal " they mean , as they want people to believe , someone who is soft in his policies abroad , who is against local government , and who is unconcerned with the taxpayer 's dollar , then the record of this party and its members demonstrate that we are not that kind of " Liberal . "
But if by a " Liberal " they mean someone who looks ahead and not behind , someone who welcomes new ideas without rigid reactions , someone who cares about the welfare of the people - their health , their housing , their schools , their jobs , their civil rights , and their civil liberties - someone who believes we can break through the stalemate and suspicions that grip us in our policies abroad , if that is what they mean by a " Liberal , " then I 'm proud to say I 'm a " Liberal . "
But first , I would like to say what I understand the word " Liberal " to mean and explain in the process why I consider myself to be a " Liberal , " and what it means in the presidential election of 1960 .
In short , having set forth my view - I hope for all time - two nights ago in Houston , on the proper relationship between church and state , I want to take the opportunity to set forth my views on the proper relationship between the state and the citizen .
This is my political credo :
I believe in human dignity as the source of national purpose , in human liberty as the source of national action , in the human heart as the source of national compassion , and in the human mind as the source of our invention and our ideas .
It is , I believe , the faith in our fellow citizens as individuals and as people that lies at the heart of the liberal faith .
For liberalism is not so much a party creed or set of fixed platform promises as it is an attitude of mind and heart , a faith in man 's ability through the experiences of his reason and judgment to increase for himself and his fellow men the amount of justice and freedom and brotherhood which all human life deserves .
I believe also in the United States of America , in the promise that it contains and has contained throughout our history of producing a society so abundant and creative and so free and responsible that it cannot only fulfill the aspirations of its citizens , but serve equally well as a beacon for all mankind .
I do not believe in a superstate . I see no magic in tax dollars which are sent to Washington and then returned .
I abhor the waste and incompetence of large-scale federal bureaucracies in this administration as well as in others .
I do not favor state compulsion when voluntary individual effort can do the job and do it well .
But I believe in a government which acts , which exercises its full powers and full responsibilities .
Government is an art and a precious obligation ; and when it has a job to do , I believe it should do it .
And this requires not only great ends but that we propose concrete means of achieving them .
Our responsibility is not discharged by announcement of virtuous ends .
Our responsibility is to achieve these objectives with social invention , with political skill , and executive vigor .
I believe for these reasons that liberalism is our best and only hope in the world today .
For the liberal society is a free society , and it is at the same time and for that reason a strong society .
Its strength is drawn from the will of free people committed to great ends and peacefully striving to meet them .
Only liberalism , in short , can repair our national power , restore our national purpose , and liberate our national energies .
And the only basic issue in the 1960 campaign is whether our government will fall in a conservative rut and die there , or whether we will move ahead in the liberal spirit of daring , of breaking new ground , of doing in our generation what Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman and Adlai Stevenson did in their time of influence and responsibility .
Our liberalism has its roots in our diverse origins . Most of us are descended from that segment of the American population which was once called an immigrant minority .
Today , along with our children and grandchildren , we do not feel minor .
We feel proud of our origins and we are not second to any group in our sense of national purpose .
For many years New York represented the new frontier to all those who came from the ends of the earth to find new opportunity and new freedom , generations of men and women who fled from the despotism of the czars , the horrors of the Nazis , the tyranny of hunger , who came here to the new frontier in the State of New York .
These men and women , a living cross section of American history , indeed , a cross section of the entire world 's history of pain and hope , made of this city not only a new world of opportunity , but a new world of the spirit as well .
Tonight we salute Governor and Senator Herbert Lehman as a symbol of that spirit , and as a reminder that the fight for full constitutional rights for all Americans is a fight that must be carried on in 1961 .
Many of these same immigrant families produced the pioneers and builders of the American labor movement .
They are the men who sweated in our shops , who struggled to create a union , and who were driven by longing for education for their children and for the children 's development .
They went to night schools ; they built their own future , their union 's future , and their country 's future , brick by brick , block by block , neighborhood by neighborhood , and now in their children 's time , suburb by suburb .
Tonight we salute George Meany as a symbol of that struggle and as a reminder that the fight to eliminate poverty and human exploitation is a fight that goes on in our day .
But in 1960 the cause of liberalism cannot content itself with carrying on the fight for human justice and economic liberalism here at home .
For here and around the world the fear of war hangs over us every morning and every night .
It lies , expressed or silent , in the minds of every American .
We cannot banish it by repeating that we are economically first or that we are militarily first , for saying so doesn't make it so .
More will be needed than goodwill missions or talking back to Soviet politicians or increasing the tempo of the arms race .
More will be needed than good intentions , for we know where that paving leads .
In Winston Churchill 's words , " We cannot escape our dangers by recoiling from them .
We dare not pretend such dangers do not exist . "
And tonight we salute Adlai Stevenson as an eloquent spokesman for the effort to achieve an intelligent foreign policy .
Our opponents would like the people to believe that in a time of danger it would be hazardous to change the administration that has brought us to this time of danger .
I think it would be hazardous not to change . I think it would be hazardous to continue four more years of stagnation and indifference here at home and abroad , of starving the underpinnings of our national power , including not only our defense but our image abroad as a friend .
This is an important election - in many ways as important as any this century - and I think that the Democratic Party and the Liberal Party here in New York , and those who believe in progress all over the United States , should be associated with us in this great effort .
The reason that Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman and Adlai Stevenson had influence abroad , and the United States in their time had it , was because they moved this country here at home , because they stood for something here in the United States , for expanding the benefits of our society to our own people , and the people around the world looked to us as a symbol of hope .
I think it is our task to re-create the same atmosphere in our own time .
Our national elections have often proved to be the turning point in the course of our country .
I am proposing that 1960 be another turning point in the history of the great Republic .
Some pundits are saying it 's 1928 all over again .
I say it 's 1932 all over again . I say this is the great opportunity that we will have in our time to move our people and this country and the people of the free world beyond the new frontiers of the 1960s .
Let me begin by expressing my appreciation for the very deep honor that you have conferred upon me .
As General de Gaulle occasionally acknowledges America to be the daughter of Europe , so I am pleased to come to Yale , the daughter of Harvard .
It might be said now that I have the best of both worlds , a Harvard education and a Yale degree .
I am particularly glad to become a Yale man because , as I think about my troubles , I find that a lot of them have come from other Yale men .
Among businessmen , I have had a minor disagreement with Roger Blough , of the law school class of 1931 , and I have had some complaints , too , from my friend Henry Ford , of the class of 1940 .
In journalism I seem to have a difference with John Hay Whitney , of the class of 1926-and sometimes I also displease Henry Luce of the class of 1920 , not to mention also William F . Buckley , Jr. , of the class of 1950 .
I even have some trouble with my Yale advisers . I get along with them , but I am not always sure how they get along with each other .
I have the warmest feelings for Chester Bowles of the class of 1924 , and for Dean Acheson of the class of 1915 , and my assistant , McGeorge Bundy , of the class of 1940 .
But I am not one hundred percent sure that these three wise and experienced Yale men wholly agree with each other on every issue .
So this administration , which aims at peaceful cooperation among all Americans , has been the victim of a certain natural pugnacity developed in this city among Yale men .
Now that I , too , am a Yale man , it is time for peace .
Last week at West Point , I availed myself of the powers of Commander-in-Chief to remit all sentences of offending cadets .
In that same spirit , and in the historic tradition of Yale , let me now offer to smoke the clay pipe of friendship with all of my brother Elis , and hope that they may be friends not only with me but even with each other .
The great enemy of truth is very often not the deliberate , contrived , and dishonest-but the myth-persistent , persuasive , and unrealistic .
Too often we hold fast to the cliches of our forebears .
We subject all facts to a prefabricated set of interpretations .
We enjoy the comfort of opinion without the discomfort of thought .
Mythology distracts us everywhere-in government as in business , in politics as in economics , in foreign affairs as in domestic affairs .
But today I want to particularly consider the myth and reality in our national economy .
In recent months many have come to feel , as I do , that the dialogue between the parties-between business and government , between the government and the public-is clogged by illusion and platitude and fails to reflect the true realities of contemporary American society .
There are three great areas of our domestic affairs in which , today , there is a danger that illusion may prevent effective action .
They are first , the question of the size and shape of government 's responsibilities ; second , the question of public fiscal policy ; and third , the matter of confidence , business confidence or public confidence , or simply confidence in America .
I want to talk about all three .
Let us take first the question of the size and shape of government .
The myth here is that government is big , and bad-and steadily getting bigger and worse .
Obviously this myth has some excuse for existence . It is true that in recent history each new administration has spent much more money than its predecessor .
Thus President Roosevelt outspent President Hoover , and with allowances for the special case of the Second World War , President Truman outspent President Roosevelt .
Just to prove that this was not a partisan matter , President Eisenhower outspent President Truman by the handsome figure of $182 billion .
It is even possible , some think , that this trend may continue .
But does it follow from this that big government is growing relatively bigger ?
It does not-for the fact is for the last fifteen years , the federal government-and also the federal debt-and also the federal bureaucracy-have grown less rapidly than the economy as a whole .
If we leave defense and space expenditures aside , the federal government since the Second World War has expanded less than any other major sector of our national life-less than industry , less than commerce , less than agriculture , less than higher education , and very much less than the noise about big government .
The truth about big government is the truth about any other great activity-it is complex .
Certainly it is true that size brings dangers-but it is also true that size can bring benefits .
Here at Yale , which has contributed so much to our national progress in science and medicine , it may be proper for me to mention one great and little noticed expansion of government which has brought strength to our whole society-the new role of our federal government as the major patron of research in science and medicine .
Few people realize that in 1961 , in support of all university research in science and medicine , three dollars out of every four came from the federal government .
I need hardly point out that this has taken place without undue enlargement of government control-that American scientists remain second to none in their independence and individualism .
I am not suggesting that federal expenditures cannot bring some measure of control .
The whole thrust of federal expenditures in agriculture has been related by purpose and design to control , as a means of dealing with the problems created by our farmers and our growing productivity .
Each sector , my point is , of activity must be approached on its own merits and in terms of specific national needs .
Generalities in regard to federal expenditures , therfore , can be misleading-each case , science , urban renewal , education , agriculture , natural resources , each case must be determined on its merits if we are to profit from our unrivaled ability to combine the strength of public and private purpose .
Next , let us turn to the problem of our fiscal policy .
Here the myths are legion and the truth hard to find .
But let me take as a prime example the problem of the federal budget .
We persist in measuring our federal fiscal integrity today by the conventional or administrative budget-with results which would be regarded as absurd in any business firm , in any country of Europe , or in any careful assessment of the reality of our national finances .
The administrative budget has sound administrative uses . But for wider purposes it is less helpful .
It omits our special trust funds and the effect that they have on our economy ; it neglects changes in assets or inventories .
It cannot tell a loan from a straight expenditure-and worst of all it cannot distinguish between operating expenditures and long-term investments .
This budget , in relation to the great problems of federal fiscal policy which are basic to our economy in 1962 , is not simply irrelevant ; it can be actively misleading .
And yet there is a mythology that measures all of our national soundness or unsoundness on the single simple basis of this same annual administrative budget .
If our federal budget is to serve not the debate but the country , we must and will find ways of clarifying this area of discourse .
Still in the area of fiscal policy , let me say a word about deficits .
The myth persists that federal deficits create inflation and budget surpluses prevent it .
Yet sizeable budget surpluses after the war did not prevent inflation , and persistent deficits for the last several years have not upset our basic price stability .
Obviously deficits are sometimes dangerous-and so are surpluses . But honest assessment plainly requires a more sophisticated view than the old and automatic cliche that deficits automatically bring inflation .
Finally , I come to the problem of confidence . Confidence is a matter of myth and also a matter of truth-and this time let me take the truth of the matter first .
It is true-and of high importance-that the prosperity of this country depends on the assurance that all major elements within it will live up to their responsibilities .
If business were to neglect its obligations to the public , if labor were blind to all public responsibility , above all , if government were to abandon its obvious-and statutory-duty of watchful concern for our economic health-if any of these things should happen , then confidence may well be weakened and the danger of stagnation would increase .
This is the true issue of confidence .
But there is also the false issue-and its simplest form is the assertion that any and all unfavorable turns of the speculative wheel-however temporary and however plainly speculative in character-are the result of , and I quote , " a lack of confidence in the national administration . "
This I must tell you , while comforting , is not wholly true .
The solid ground of mutual confidence is the necessary partnership of government with all of the sectors of our society in the steady quest for economic progress .
Corporate plans are based not on a political confidence in party leaders but on an economic confidence in the nation 's ability to invest and produce and consume .
Business had full confidence in the administrations in power in 1929 , 1954 , 1958 , and 1960-but this was not enough to prevent recession when business lacked full confidence in the economy .
What matters is the capacity of the nation as a whole to deal with its economic problems and its opportunities .
What is at stake in our economic decisions today is not some grand warfare of rival ideologies which will sweep the country with passion but the practical management of a modern economy .
What we need is not labels and cliches but more basic discussion of the sophisticated and technical questions involved in keeping a great economic machine moving ahead .
The national interest lies in high employment and steady expansion of output , in stable prices and a strong dollar .
The declaration of such objectives is easy ; their attainment in an intricate and interdependent economy and world is a little more difficult .
To attain them , we require not some automatic response but hard thought .
As we work in consonance to meet the authentic problems of our times , we will generate a vision and an energy which will demonstrate anew to the world the superior vitality and the strength of the free society .
President Dwight D . Eisenhower
Farewell Address , January 17 , 1961 .
Good evening , my fellow Americans : First , I should like to express my gratitude to the radio and television networks for the opportunity they have given me over the years to bring reports and messages to our nation .
My special thanks go to them for the opportunity of addressing you this evening .
Three days from now , after a half century of service of our country , I shall lay down the responsibilities of office as , in traditional and solemn ceremony , the authority of the Presidency is vested in my successor .
This evening I come to you with a message of leave-taking and farewell , and to share a few final thoughts with you , my countrymen .
Like every other citizen , I wish the new President , and all who will labor with him , Godspeed .
I pray that the coming years will be blessed with peace and prosperity for all .
Our people expect their President and the Congress to find essential agreement on questions of great moment , the wise resolution of which will better shape the future of the nation .
My own relations with Congress , which began on a remote and tenuous basis when , long ago , a member of the Senate appointed me to West Point , have since ranged to the intimate during the war and immediate post-war period , and finally to the mutually interdependent during these past eight years .
In this final relationship , the Congress and the Administration have , on most vital issues , cooperated well , to serve the nation well rather than mere partisanship , and so have assured that the business of the nation should go forward .
So my official relationship with Congress ends in a feeling on my part , of gratitude that we have been able to do so much together .
We now stand ten years past the midpoint of a century that has witnessed four major wars among great nations .
Three of these involved our own country . Despite these holocausts America is today the strongest , the most influential and most productive nation in the world .
Understandably proud of this pre-eminence , we yet realize that America 's leadership and prestige depend , not merely upon our unmatched material progress , riches and military strength , but on how we use our power in the interests of world peace and human betterment .
Throughout America 's adventure in free government , such basic purposes have been to keep the peace ; to foster progress in human achievement , and to enhance liberty , dignity and integrity among peoples and among nations .
To strive for less would be unworthy of a free and religious people .
Any failure traceable to arrogance or our lack of comprehension or readiness to sacrifice would inflict upon us a grievous hurt , both at home and abroad .
Progress toward these noble goals is persistently threatened by the conflict now engulfing the world .
It commands our whole attention , absorbs our very beings .
We face a hostile ideology global in scope , atheistic in character , ruthless in purpose , and insidious in method .
Unhappily the danger it poses promises to be of indefinite duration .
To meet it successfully , there is called for , not so much the emotional and transitory sacrifices of crisis , but rather those which enable us to carry forward steadily , surely , and without complaint the burdens of a prolonged and complex struggle-with liberty the stake .
Only thus shall we remain , despite every provocation , on our charted course toward permanent peace and human betterment .
Crises there will continue to be . In meeting them , whether foreign or domestic , great or small , there is a recurring temptation to feel that some spectacular and costly action could become the miraculous solution to all current difficulties , A huge increase in the newer elements of our defenses ; development of unrealistic programs to cure every ill in agriculture ; a dramatic expansion in basic and applied research-these and many other possibilities , each possibly promising in itself , may be suggested as the only way to the road we wish to travel .
But each proposal must be weighed in light of a broader consideration ; the need to maintain balance in and among national programs-balance between the private and the public economy , balance between the cost and hoped for advantages-balance between the clearly necessary and the comfortably desirable ; balance between our essential requirements as a nation and the duties imposed by the nation upon the individual ; balance between the actions of the moment and the national welfare of the future .
Good judgment seeks balance and progress ; lack of it eventually finds imbalance and frustration .
The record of many decades stands as proof that our people and their Government have , in the main , understood these truths and have responded to them well in the face of threat and stress .
But threats , new in kind or degree , constantly arise .
Of these , I mention two only .
A vital element in keeping the peace is our military establishment .
Our arms must be mighty , ready for instant action , so that no potential aggressor may be tempted to risk his own destruction .
Our military organization today bears little relation to that known by any of my predecessors in peacetime , or indeed by the fighting men of World War II or Korea .
Until the latest of our world conflicts , the United States had no armaments industry .
American makers of plowshares could , with time and as required , make swords as well .
But now we can no longer risk emergency improvisation of national defense ; we have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions .
Added to this , three and a half million men and women are directly engaged in the defense establishment .
We annually spend on military security more than the net income of all United States corporations .
This conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience .
The total influence-economic , political , even spiritual-is felt in every city , every State house , every office of the Federal government .
We recognize the imperative need for this development . Yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications .
Our toil , resources and livelihood are all involved ; so is the very structure of our society .
In the councils of government , we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence , whether sought or unsought , by the military-industrial complex .
The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist .
We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes .
We should take nothing for granted . Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals , so that security and liberty may prosper together .
Akin to , and largely responsible for the sweeping changes in our industrial-military posture , has been the technological revolution during recent decades .
In this revolution , research has become central , it also becomes more formalized , complex , and costly .
A steadily increasing share is conducted for , by , or at the direction of , the Federal government .
Today , the solitary inventor , tinkering in his shop , has been overshadowed by task forces of scientists in laboratories and testing fields .
In the same fashion , the free university , historically the fountainhead of free ideas and scientific discovery , has experienced a revolution in the conduct of research .
Partly because of the huge costs involved , a government contract becomes virtually a substitute for intellectual curiosity .
For every old blackboard there are now hundreds of new electronic computers .
The prospect of domination of the nation 's scholars by Federal employment , project allocations , and the power of money is ever present-and is gravely to be regarded .
Yet , in holding scientific research and discovery in respect , as we should , we must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific-technological elite .
It is the task of statesmanship to mold , to balance , and to integrate these and other forces , new and old , within the principles of our democratic system-ever aiming toward the supreme goals of our free society .
Another factor in maintaining balance involves the element of time .
As we peer into society 's future , we-you and I , and our government-must avoid the impulse to live only for today , plundering for , for our own ease and convenience , the precious resources of tomorrow .
We cannot mortgage the material assets of our grandchildren without asking the loss also of their political and spiritual heritage .
We want democracy to survive for all generations to come , not to become the insolvent phantom of tomorrow .
Down the long lane of the history yet to be written America knows that this world of ours , ever growing smaller , must avoid becoming a community of dreadful fear and hate , and be , instead , a proud confederation of mutual trust and respect .
Such a confederation must be one of equals . The weakest must come to the conference table with the same confidence as do we , protected as we are by our moral , economic , and military strength .
That table , though scarred by many past frustrations , cannot be abandoned for the certain agony of the battlefield .
Disarmament , with mutual honor and confidence , is a continuing imperative .
Together we must learn how to compose differences , not with arms , but with intellect and decent purpose .
Because this need is so sharp and apparent I confess that I lay down my official responsibilities in this field with a definite sense of disappointment .
As one who has witnessed the horror and the lingering sadness of war-as one who knows that another war could utterly destroy this civilization which has been so slowly and painfully built over thousands of years-I wish I could say tonight that a lasting peace is in sight .
Happily , I can say that war has been avoided .
Steady progress toward our ultimate goal has been made . But , so much remains to be done .
As a private citizen , I shall never cease to do what little I can to help the world advance along that road .
So-in this my last good night to you as your President-I thank you for the many opportunities you have given me for public service in war and peace .
I trust that in that service you find some things worthy ; as for the rest of it , I know you will find ways to improve performance in the future .
You and I-my fellow citizens-need to be strong in our faith that all nations , under God , will reach the goal of peace with justice .
May we be ever unswerving in devotion to principle , confident but humble with power , diligent in pursuit of the Nations ' great goals .
To all the peoples of the world , I once more give expression to America 's prayerful and continuing aspiration :
We pray that peoples of all faiths , all races , all nations , may have their great human needs satisfied ; that those now denied opportunity shall come to enjoy it to the full ; that all who yearn for freedom may experience its spiritual blessings ; that those who have freedom will understand , also , its heavy responsibilities ; that all who are insensitive to the needs of others will learn charity ; that the scourges of poverty , disease and ignorance will be made to disappear from the earth , and that , in the goodness of time , all peoples will come to live together in a peace guaranteed by the binding force of mutual respect and love .
Now , on Friday noon , I am to become a private citizen .
I am proud to do so . I look forward to it .
Thank you , and , good night .
We observe today not a victory of party but a celebration of freedom- symbolizing an end as well as a beginning-signifying renewal as well as change .
For I have sworn before you and Almighty God the same solemn oath our forebears prescribed nearly a century and three quarters ago .
The world is very different now . For man holds in his mortal hands the power to abolish all forms of human poverty and all forms of human life .
And yet the same revolutionary beliefs for which our forebears fought are still at issue around the globe-the belief that the rights of man come not from the generosity of the state but from the hand of God .
We dare not forget today that we are the heirs of that first revolution .
Let the word go forth from this time and place , to friend and foe alike , that the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans-born in this century , tempered by war , disciplined by a hard and bitter peace , proud of our ancient heritage-and unwilling to witness or permit the slow undoing of those human rights to which this nation has always been committed , and to which we are committed today at home and around the world .
Let every nation know , whether it wishes us well or ill , that we shall pay any price , bear any burden , meet any hardship , support any friend , oppose any foe , to assure the survival and the success of liberty .
This much we pledge-and more .
To those old allies whose cultural and spiritual origins we share , we pledge the loyalty of faithful friends .
United , there is little we cannot do in a host of cooperative ventures .
Divided , there is little we can do-for we dare not meet a powerful challenge at odds and split asunder .
To those new states whom we welcome to the ranks of the free , we pledge our word that one form of colonial control shall not have passed away merely to be replaced by a far more iron tyranny .
We shall not always expect to find them supporting our view .
But we shall always hope to find them strongly supporting their own freedom-and to remember that in the past , those who foolishly sought power by riding the back of the tiger ended up inside .
To those peoples in the huts and villages of half the globe struggling to break the bonds of mass misery , we pledge our best efforts to help them help themselves , for whatever period is required-not because the Communists may be doing it , not because we seek their votes , but because it is right .
If a free society cannot help the many who are poor , it cannot save the few who are rich .
To our sister republics south of our border , we offer a special pledge -to convert our good words into good deeds-in a new alliance for progress-to assist free men and free governments in casting off the chains of poverty .
But this peaceful revolution of hope cannot become the prey of hostile powers .
Let all our neighbors know that we shall join with them to oppose aggression or subversion anywhere in the Americas .
And let every other power know that this hemisphere intends to remain the master of its own house .
To that world assembly of sovereign states , the United Nations , our last best hope in an age where the instruments of war have far outpaced the instruments of peace , we renew our pledge of suppor t-t o prevent it from becoming merely a forum for invective-to strengthen its shield of the new and the weak-and to enlarge the area in which its writ may run .
Finally , to those nations who would make themselves our adversary , we offer not a pledge but a request : that both sides begin anew the quest for peace , before the dark powers of destruction unleashed by science engulf all humanity in planned or accidental self-destruction .
We dare not tempt them with weakness . For only when our arms are sufficient beyond doubt can we be certain beyond doubt that they will never be employed .
But neither can two great and powerful groups of nations take comfort from our present course-both sides overburdened by the cost of modern weapons , both rightly alarmed by the steady spread of the deadly atom , yet both racing to alter that uncertain balance of terror that stays the hand of mankind 's final war .
So let us begin anew-remembering on both sides that civility is not a sign of weakness , and sincerity is always subject to proof .
Let us never negotiate out of fear . But let us never fear to negotiate .
Let both sides explore what problems unite us instead of belaboring these problems which divide us .
Let both sides , for the first time , formulate serious and precise proposals for the inspection and control of arms-and bring the absolute power to destroy other nations under the absolute control of all nations .
Let both sides seek to invoke the wonders of science instead of its terrors .
Together let us explore the stars , conquer the deserts , eradicate disease , tap the ocean depths , and encourage the arts and commerce .
Let both sides unite to heed in all corners of the earth the command of Isaiah-to " undo the heavy burdens [ and ] let the oppressed go free . "
And if a beachhead of cooperation may push back the jungle of suspicion , let both sides join in creating a new endeavor , not a new balance of power , but a new world of law , where the strong are just and the weak secure and the peace preserved .
All this will not be finished in the first one hundred days .
Nor will it finished in the first one thousand days , nor in the life of this administration , nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet .
But let us begin .
In your hands , my fellow citizens , more than mine , will rest the final success or failure of our course .
Since this country was founded , each generation of Americans has been summoned to give testimony to its national loyalty .
The graves of young Americans who answered the call to service surround the globe .
Now the trumpet summons us again-not as a call to bear arms , though arms we need-not as a call to battle , though embattled we are -but as a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle , year in year out , " rejoicing in hope , patient in tribulation " -a struggle against the common enemies of man : tyranny , poverty , disease , and war itself .
Can we forge against these enemies a grand and global alliance , North and South , East and West , that can assure a more fruitful life for all mankind ?
Will you join in that historic effort ?
In the long history of the world , only a few generations have been granted the role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger .
I do not shrink from this responsibility-I welcome it . I do not believe that any of us would exchange places with any other people of any other generation .
The energy , the faith , the devotion which we bring to this endeavor will light our country and all who serve it-and the glow from that fire can truly light the world .
And so , my fellow Americans : ask not what your country can do for you-ask what you can do for your country .
My fellow citizens of the world : ask not what America will do for you , but together what we can do for the freedom of man .
Finally , whether you are citizens of America or citizens of the world , ask of us here the same high standards of strength and sacrifice which we ask of you .
With a good conscience our only sure reward , with history the final judge of our deeds , let us go forth to lead the land we love , asking His blessing and His help , but knowing that here on earth God 's work must truly be our own .
In recent months I have spoken many times about how difficult and dangerous a period it is through which we now move .
I would like to take this opportunity to say a word about the American spirit in this time of trial .
In the most critical periods of our nation 's history , there have always been those fringes of our society who have sought to escape their own responsibility by finding a simple solution , an appealing slogan , or a convenient scapegoat .
Financial crises could be explained by the presence of too many immigrants or too few greenbacks .
War could be attributed to munitions makers or international bankers .
Peace conferences failed because we were duped by the British or tricked by the French or deceived by the Russians .
It was not the presence of Soviet troops in Eastern Europe that drove it to communism , it was the sell-out at Yalta .
It was not a civil war that removed China from the free world , it was treason in high places .
At times these fanatics have achieved a temporary success among those who lack the will or the vision to face unpleasant tasks or unsolved problems .
But in time the basic good sense and stability of the great American consensus has always prevailed .
Now we are face to face once again with a period of heightened peril .
The risks are great , the burdens heavy , the problems incapable of swift or lasting solution .
And under the strains and frustrations imposed by constant tension and harassment , the discordant voices of extremism are heard once again in the land .
Men who are unwilling to face up to the danger from without are convinced that the real danger comes from within .
They look suspiciously at their neighbors and their leaders . They call for a ' man on horseback ' because they do not trust the people .
They find treason in our finest churches , in our highest court , and even in the treatment of our water .
They equate the Democratic Party with the welfare state , the welfare state with socialism , and socialism with communism .
They object quite rightly to politics ' intruding on the military - but they are anxious for the military to engage in politics .
But you and I and most Americans take a different view of our peril .
We know that it comes from without , not within .
It must be met by quiet preparedness , not provocative speeches .
And the steps taken this year to bolster our defenses-to increase our missile forces , to put more planes on alert , to provide more airlift and sealift and ready divisions-to make more certain than ever before that this nation has all the power it will need to deter any attack of any kind-those steps constitute the most effective answer that can be made to those who would sow the seeds of doubt and hate .
So let us not heed these counsels of fear and suspicion .
Let us concentrate more on keeping enemy bombers and missiles away from our shores , and concentrate less on keeping neighbors away from our shelters .
Let us devote more energy to organize the free and friendly nations of the world , with common trade and strategic goals , and devote less energy to organizing armed bands of civilian guerrillas that are more likely to supply local vigilantes than national vigilance .
Let our patriotism be reflected in the creation of confidence rather than crusades of suspicion .
Let us prove we think our country great by striving to make it greater .
And , above all , let us remember that , however serious the outlook , the one great irreversible trend in world history is on the side of liberty-and so , for all time to come , are we .
This is a great anniversary of a great university . It is in fact a double anniversary .
One hundred years ago this July Abraham Lincoln signed the Morrill act , establishing a nationwide system of land-grant colleges and universities .
Six years later the University of California received its charter ; and , from the moment of its foundation , its remarkable contributions to State and Nation have proven the wisdom of the land-grant college program .
The first graduating class at Berkeley produced , I am informed , a Governor of California , two regents of the university , a college professor , a clergyman , a State assemblyman , and assorted lawyers , engineers and civic leaders-all out of 12 graduates .
Today , you are doing nearly as well . When I observe the men who surround me in Washington-when I reflect that the Secretary of State , the Secretary of Defense , the Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission , the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency , and the Ambassador to India are all graduates or former students of this university-I am forced to confront an uncomfortable truth , and so are you : that the New Frontier may well owe more to Berkeley than to Harvard .
This has been a week of momentous events around the world .
The long , painful struggle in Algeria drew nearer to solution .
Both nuclear powers and neutrals labored at Geneva to renew the quest for disarmament .
The Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union and the United States met once again on the subject of Berlin .
The Congress opened hearings on a trade bill of far-reaching importance to the growth and strength of this Nation and the Atlantic Community .
And my wife had her first and last ride on an elephant .
But history may well remember this week for an act of lesser immediate impac t-t he decision by the United States and the Soviet Union to seek concrete agreements on the joint exploration of space .
Experience has taught us that an agreement to negotiate does not always lead to negotiated agreements .
But should such a joint effort be realized , its significance could well be tremendous .
In terms of space science , our combined knowledge and efforts can benefit the peoples of all nations ; joint wealth , satellite systems to provide more ample warning against the destructive powers of storm-joint communications systems to draw the world closer together-and cooperation in space medicine research and space tracking operations to speed the day when man will explore the moon and even beyond .
But the scientific gains a joint effort would offer might be small compared to the gains for world peace .
For a cooperative Soviet-American effort to space science and exploration would emphasize the interests that unite us instead of the conflicts that divide us .
It offers us an area in which the stale , sterile dogmas of the cold war can be left literally a quarter of a million miles behind .
And it would remind us on both sides that knowledge , not hate , is the passkey to the future-that knowledge transcends national antagonisms-that it speaks a universal language-that it is the possession , not of a single class , a single nation or a single ideology , but of all mankind .
I hardly need to emphasize the pursuit of knowledge here .
Your faculty includes more Nobel laureates than any other faculty in the world-more in this one community than our principal adversary has received since the awards began in 1901 .
I am happy to pay honor to those winners who are here on the platform today-and to the community which has sought and sustained them .
And I know that the University California will continue to grow as an intellectual center because your presidents , your chancellors , and your professors have rigorously defended that unhampered freedom of discussion and inquiry which is the heart of the intellectual enterprise and the soul of the free university .
We may be proud as a Nation of our record in scientific achievement , but at the same time we must be humbled by an understanding of the interdependence of all knowledge .
I 'm certain that every scholar and scientist present today would agree that his own work has benefited immeasurably from the work of men and women in other countries .
The prospect of a partnership with Soviet scientists in the exploration of space opens up exciting prospects of collaboration in other areas of learning .
And cooperation in the pursuit of knowledge can hopefully lead to cooperation in the pursuit of peace .
Yet the pursuit of knowledge itself implies a world where men are free to follow out the logic of their own ideas .
It implies a world where nations are free to solve their own problems and to realize their own ideals .
It implies , in short , a world where collaboration emerges from the voluntary decisions of nations strong in their own independence and their own self-respect .
It implies , I believe , the kind of world which is emerging before our eyes-the world produced by the revolution of national independence which is today sweeping everywhere across the earth .
I sometimes think that we are impressed too much by the clamor of daily urgencies .
The newspaper headlines and the television screen give us the short view .
They so flood us with stop-press detail that we lose sight of the grand movements of history .
Yet it is the profound tendencies , and not the passing excitements , that will shape the future .
The short view gives us the impression as a nation of being shoved and harried , everywhere on the defense .
But this impression is surely an optical illusion . From the perspective of Moscow , the world today may seem even more troublesome , intractable , and frustrating than it does to us .
The leaders of the Communist world are not only confronted by acute internal problems in each Communist country-the failure of agriculture , the rising discontent of the youth and the intellectuals , the demands of technical and managerial groups for status and security .
They are confronted in addition by profound divisions within the Communist world itself-divisions which have already shattered the image of communism as a universal system guaranteed to abolish all social and international conflicts , the most valuable asset which the Communists had for many years .
Wisdom requires the long view . And the long view shows us that the revolution of national independence is a fundamental fact of our era .
This revolution cannot be stopped .
As new nations emerge from the oblivion of centuries , their first aspiration is to affirm their national identity .
Their deepest hope is for a world where , within a framework of international cooperation , every country can solve its own problems according to its own traditions and ideals .
It is in the interests of the pursuit of knowledge-and it is in our own national interes t-t hat this revolution of national independence succeed .
For the Communists rest everything on the idea of a monolithic world-a world where all knowledge has a single pattern , all societies move toward a single model , all problems have a single solution , and all roads lead to a single destination .
The pursuit of knowledge , on the other hand , rests everything on the opposite idea-on the idea of a world based on diversity , self-determination and freedom .
And that is the kind of world to which we Americans , as a Nation , are committed by the principles on which this republic was formed .
As men conduct the pursuit of knowledge , they create a world which freely unites national diversity and international partnership .
This emerging world is incompatible with the Communist conception of world order .
It will irresistibly burst the bonds of Communist organization and Communist ideology .
And diversity and independence , far from being opposed to the American conception of world order , represent the very essence of our vision of the future .
There used to be much talk a few years ago about the inevitable triumph of communism .
We hear such talk much less now . No one who examines the modern world can doubt that the great currents of history are carrying the world away from the monolithic idea toward the pluralist idea-away from communism and toward national independence and freedom .
No one can doubt that the wave of the future is not the conquest of the world by a single dogmatic creed , but the liberation of the diverse energies of free nations and free men .
No one can doubt that cooperation in the pursuit of knowledge must lead to freedom of the mind and of the soul .
Beyond the drumfire of daily crisis there is arising the outlines of a robust and vital world community , founded on nations secure in their own independence , dedicated to freedom of choice , and united by allegiance to world peace and justice .
It would be foolish to say that this world will be won tomorrow , or the day after .
The processes of history are fitful , halting , and aggravating .
There will be frustrations and setbacks . There will be times of anxiety and gloom .
The specter of thermonuclear war will hang over mankind ; and we must heed the advice of Oliver Wendell Holmes of " freedom leaning on her spear " until all nations are wise enough to disarm safely and effectively .
Yet we can have a new confidence today in the direction in which history is moving .
Nothing is more stirring than the recognition of public purpose .
Every great age is marked by innovation and daring-by the ability to meet unprecedented problems with intelligent solutions .
In a time of turbulence and change , it is more true than ever that knowledge is power ; for only by true understanding and steadfast judgment are we able to master the challenge of history .
If this is so , we must strive to acquire knowledge-and to apply it with wisdom .
We must reject oversimplified theories of international life-the theory that American mission is to remake the world in the American image .
We must seize the vision of a free and diverse world-and shape our policies to speed progress toward a flexible world order .
This is the unifying spirit of our policies in the world .
The purpose of our aid programs must be to help developing countries to move forward as rapidly as possible on the road to genuine national independence .
Our military policies must assist nations to protect the processes of democratic reform and development against disruption and intervention .
Our diplomatic policies must strengthen our relations with the whole world , with our several alliances and with the United Nations .
As we press forward on every front to realize the flexible world order , the role of the university becomes ever more important both as a reservoir of ideas and as a repository of the long view .
" Knowledge is the great sun of the firmament , " said Daniel Webster .
" Life and power are scattered with all its beams . "
In its light , we must think and act not only for the moment , but for the century .
I am reminded of the story of Marshal Lyautey , who once asked his gardener to plant a tree .
The gardener objected that the tree was slow growing and would not reach maturity for a hundred years .
The marshal replied , " In that case , there is no time to lose , plant it this afternoon . "
Today a world of knowledge-a world of cooperation-a just and lasting peace-may well be years away .
But we have no time to lose . Let us plant our trees this very afternoon .
President Pitzer , Mr. Vice President , Governor , Congressman Thomas , Senator Wiley , and Congressman Miller , Mr. Webb , Mr. Bell , scientists , distinguished guests , and ladies and gentlemen :
I appreciate your president having made me an honorary visiting professor , and I will assure you that my first lecture will be very brief .
I am delighted to be here and I 'm particularly delighted to be here on this occasion .
We meet at a college noted for knowledge , in a city noted for progress , in a State noted for strength , and we stand in need of all three , for we meet in an hour of change and challenge , in a decade of hope and fear , in an age of both knowledge and ignorance .
The greater our knowledge increases , the greater our ignorance unfolds .
Despite the striking fact that most of the scientists that the world has ever known are alive and working today , despite the fact that this Nation¹s own scientific manpower is doubling every 12 years in a rate of growth more than three times that of our population as a whole , despite that , the vast stretches of the unknown and the unanswered and the unfinished still far outstrip our collective comprehension .
No man can fully grasp how far and how fast we have come , but condense , if you will , the 50,000 years of man¹s recorded history in a time span of but a half-century .
Stated in these terms , we know very little about the first 40 years , except at the end of them advanced man had learned to use the skins of animals to cover them .
Then about 10 years ago , under this standard , man emerged from his caves to construct other kinds of shelter .
Only five years ago man learned to write and use a cart with wheels .
Christianity began less than two years ago . The printing press came this year , and then less than two months ago , during this whole 50-year span of human history , the steam engine provided a new source of power .
Newton explored the meaning of gravity . Last month electric lights and telephones and automobiles and airplanes became available .
Only last week did we develop penicillin and television and nuclear power , and now if America 's new spacecraft succeeds in reaching Venus , we will have literally reached the stars before midnight tonight .
This is a breathtaking pace , and such a pace cannot help but create new ills as it dispels old , new ignorance , new problems , new dangers .
Surely the opening vistas of space promise high costs and hardships , as well as high reward .
So it is not surprising that some would have us stay where we are a little longer to rest , to wait .
But this city of Houston , this State of Texas , this country of the United States was not built by those who waited and rested and wished to look behind them .
This country was conquered by those who moved forward-and so will space .
William Bradford , speaking in 1630 of the founding of the Plymouth Bay Colony , said that all great and honorable actions are accompanied with great difficulties , and both must be enterprised and overcome with answerable courage .
If this capsule history of our progress teaches us anything , it is that man , in his quest for knowledge and progress , is determined and cannot be deterred .
The exploration of space will go ahead , whether we join in it or not , and it is one of the great adventures of all time , and no nation which expects to be the leader of other nations can expect to stay behind in the race for space .
Those who came before us made certain that this country rode the first waves of the industrial revolutions , the first waves of modern invention , and the first wave of nuclear power , and this generation does not intend to founder in the backwash of the coming age of space .
We mean to be a part of it-we mean to lead it .
For the eyes of the world now look into space , to the moon and to the planets beyond , and we have vowed that we shall not see it governed by a hostile flag of conquest , but by a banner of freedom and peace .
We have vowed that we shall not see space filled with weapons of mass destruction , but with instruments of knowledge and understanding .
Yet the vows of this Nation can only be fulfilled if we in this Nation are first , and , therefore , we intend to be first .
In short , our leadership in science and in industry , our hopes for peace and security , our obligations to ourselves as well as others , all require us to make this effort , to solve these mysteries , to solve them for the good of all men , and to become the world 's leading space-faring nation .
We set sail on this new sea because there is new knowledge to be gained , and new rights to be won , and they must be won and used for the progress of all people .
For space science , like nuclear science and all technology , has no conscience of its own .
Whether it will become a force for good or ill depends on man , and only if the United States occupies a position of pre-eminence can we help decide whether this new ocean will be a sea of peace or a new terrifying theater of war .
I do not say the we should or will go unprotected against the hostile misuse of space any more than we go unprotected against the hostile use of land or sea , but I do say that space can be explored and mastered without feeding the fires of war , without repeating the mistakes that man has made in extending his writ around this globe of ours .
There is no strife , no prejudice , no national conflict in outer space as yet .
Its hazards are hostile to us all . Its conquest deserves the best of all mankind , and its opportunity for peaceful cooperation many never come again .
But why , some say , the moon ? Why choose this as our goal ?
And they may well ask why climb the highest mountain ?
Why , 35 years ago , fly the Atlantic ? Why does Rice play Texas ?
We choose to go to the moon . We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things , not only because they are easy , but because they are hard , because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills , because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept , one we are unwilling to postpone , and one which we intend to win , and the others , too .
It is for these reasons that I regard the decision last year to shift our efforts in space from low to high gear as among the most important decisions that will be made during my incumbency in the office of the Presidency .
In the last 24 hours we have seen facilities now being created for the greatest and most complex exploration in man 's history .
We have felt the ground shake and the air shattered by the testing of a Saturn C-1 booster rocket , many times as powerful as the Atlas which launched John Glenn , generating power equivalent to 10,000 automobiles with their accelerators on the floor .
We have seen the site where the F-1 rocket engines , each one as powerful as all eight engines of the Saturn combined , will be clustered together to make the advanced Saturn missile , assembled in a new building to be built at Cape Canaveral as tall as a 48 story structure , as wide as a city block , and as long as two lengths of this field .
Within these last 19 months at least 45 satellites have circled the earth .
Some 40 of them were " made in the United States of America " and they were far more sophisticated and supplied far more knowledge to the people of the world than those of the Soviet Union .
The Mariner spacecraft now on its way to Venus is the most intricate instrument in the history of space science .
The accuracy of that shot is comparable to firing a missile from Cape Canaveral and dropping it in this stadium between the the 40-yard lines .
Transit satellites are helping our ships at sea to steer a safer course .
Tiros satellites have given us unprecedented warnings of hurricanes and storms , and will do the same for forest fires and icebergs .
We have had our failures , but so have others , even if they do not admit them .
And they may be less public .
To be sure , we are behind , and will be behind for some time in manned flight .
But we do not intend to stay behind , and in this decade , we shall make up and move ahead .
The growth of our science and education will be enriched by new knowledge of our universe and environment , by new techniques of learning and mapping and observation , by new tools and computers for industry , medicine , the home as well as the school .
Technical institutions , such as Rice , will reap the harvest of these gains .
And finally , the space effort itself , while still in its infancy , has already created a great number of new companies , and tens of thousands of new jobs .
Space and related industries are generating new demands in investment and skilled personnel , and this city and this State , and this region , will share greatly in this growth .
What was once the furthest outpost on the old frontier of the West will be the furthest outpost on the new frontier of science and space .
Houston , your City of Houston , with its Manned Spacecraft Center , will become the heart of a large scientific and engineering community .
During the next 5 years the National Aeronautics and Space Administration expects to double the number of scientists and engineers in this area , to increase its outlays for salaries and expenses to $60 million a year ; to invest some $200 million in plant and laboratory facilities ; and to direct or contract for new space efforts over $1 billion from this Center in this City .
To be sure , all this costs us all a good deal of money .
This year¹s space budget is three times what it was in January 1961 , and it is greater than the space budget of the previous eight years combined .
That budget now stands at $ 5,400 million a year-a staggering sum , though somewhat less than we pay for cigarettes and cigars every year .
Space expenditures will soon rise some more , from 40 cents per person per week to more than 50 cents a week for every man , woman and child in the United Stated , for we have given this program a high national priority-even though I realize that this is in some measure an act of faith and vision , for we do not now know what benefits await us .
But if I were to say , my fellow citizens , that we shall send to the moon , 240,000 miles away from the control station in Houston , a giant rocket more than 300 feet tall , the length of this football field , made of new metal alloys , some of which have not yet been invented , capable of standing heat and stresses several times more than have ever been experienced , fitted together with a precision better than the finest watch , carrying all the equipment needed for propulsion , guidance , control , communications , food and survival , on an untried mission , to an unknown celestial body , and then return it safely to earth , re-entering the atmosphere at speeds of over 25,000 miles per hour , causing heat about half that of the temperature of the sun-almost as hot as it is here today-and do all this , and do it right , and do it first before this decade is ou t-t hen we must be bold .
I 'm the one who is doing all the work , so we just want you to stay cool for a minute .
[ laughter ]
However , I think we 're going to do it , and I think that we must pay what needs to be paid .
I don't think we ought to waste any money , but I think we ought to do the job .
And this will be done in the decade of the sixties .
It may be done while some of you are still here at school at this college and university .
It will be done during the term of office of some of the people who sit here on this platform .
But it will be done . And it will be done before the end of this decade .
I am delighted that this university is playing a part in putting a man on the moon as part of a great national effort of the United States of America .
Many years ago the great British explorer George Mallory , who was to die on Mount Everest , was asked why did he want to climb it .
He said , " Because it is there . "
Well , space is there , and we 're going to climb it , and the moon and the planets are there , and new hopes for knowledge and peace are there .
And , therefore , as we set sail we ask God 's blessing on the most hazardous and dangerous and greatest adventure on which man has ever embarked .
Thank you .
A Strategy of Peace
President John F . Kennedy , Commencement Address , American University , Washington , Monday , June 10 , 1963
President Anderson , members of the faculty , board of trustees , distinguished guests - my old colleague Senator Bob Byrd , who has earned his degree through many years of attending night law school while I am earning mine in the next thirty minutes - distinguished guests , ladies and gentlemen :
It is with great pride that I participate in this ceremony of the American University sponsored by the Methodist Church , founded by Bishop John Fletcher Hurst and first opened by President Woodrow Wilson in 1914 .
This is a young and growing university , but it has already fulfilled Bishop Hurst 's enlightened hope for the study of history and public affairs in a city devoted to the making of history and to the conduct of the public 's business .
By sponsoring this institution of higher learning for all who wish to learn , whatever their color or their creed , the Methodists of this area and the nation deserve the nation 's thanks .
And I commend all those who are today graduating .
Professor Woodrow Wilson once said that every man sent out from a university should be a man of his nation as well as a man of his time and I 'm confident that the men and women who carry the honor of graduating from this institution will continue to give from their lives , from their talents a high measure of public service and public support .
" There are few earthly things more beautiful than a university , " wrote John Masefield in his tribute to English universities - and his words are equally true today .
He did not refer to towers or to campuses . He admired the splendid beauty of a university , because it was , he said , " a place where those who hate ignorance may strive to know , where those who perceive truth may strive to make others see . "
I have , therefore , chosen this time and place to discuss a topic on which ignorance too often abounds and the truth too rarely perceived - and that is the most important topic on earth : peace .
What kind of peace do I mean and what kind of a peace do we seek ?
Not a Pax Americana enforced on the world by American weapons of war , not the peace of the grave or the security of the slave .
I am talking about genuine peace - the kind of peace that makes life on earth worth living - and the kind that enables men and nations to grow and to hope and build a better life for their children - not merely peace for Americans but peace for all men and women - not merely peace in our time but peace in all time .
I speak of peace because of the new face of war .
Total war makes no sense in an age where great powers can maintain large and relatively invulnerable nuclear forces and refuse to surrender without resort to those forces .
It makes no sense in an age where a single nuclear weapon contains almost ten times the explosive force delivered by all the Allied air forces in the second world war .
It makes no sense in an age when the deadly poisons produced by a nuclear exchange would be carried by wind and water and soil and seed to the far corners of the globe and to generations yet unborn .
Today the expenditure of billions of dollars every year on weapons acquired for the purpose of making sure we never need them is essential to the keeping of peace .
But surely the acquisition of such idle stockpiles - which can only destroy and never create - is not the only , much less the most efficient , means of assuring peace .
I speak of peace , therefore , as the necessary rational end of rational men .
I realize the pursuit of peace is not as dramatic as the pursuit of war - and frequently the words of the pursuers fall on deaf ears .
But we have no more urgent task .
Some say that it is useless to speak of peace or world law or world disarmament - and that it will be useless until the leaders of the Soviet Union adopt a more enlightened attitude .
I hope they do . I believe we can help them do it .
But I also believe that we must re-examine our own attitudes - as individuals and as a nation - for our attitude is as essential as theirs .
And every graduate of this school , every thoughtful citizen who despairs of war and wishes to bring peace , should begin by looking inward - by examining his own attitude towards the possibilities of peace , towards the Soviet Union , towards the course of the cold war and towards freedom and peace here at home .
First : Examine our attitude towards peace itself . Too many of us think it is impossible .
Too many think it is unreal . But that is a dangerous , defeatist belief .
It leads to the conclusion that war is inevitable - that mankind is doomed - that we are gripped by forces we cannot control .
We need not accept that view . Our problems are man-made .
Therefore , they can be solved by man . And man can be as big as he wants .
No problem of human destiny is beyond human beings . Man 's reason and spirit have often solved the seemingly unsolvable - and we believe they can do it again .
I am not referring to the absolute , infinite concepts of universal peace and goodwill of which some fantasies and fanatics dream .
I do not deny the value of hopes and dreams but we merely invite discouragement and incredulity by making that our only and immediate goal .
Let us focus instead on a more practical , more attainable peace - based not on a sudden revolution in human nature but on a gradual evolution in human institutions - on a series of concrete actions and effective agreement which are in the interests of all concerned .
There is no single , simple key to this peace - no grand or magic formula to be adopted by one or two powers .
Genuine peace must be the product of many nations , the sum of many acts .
It must be dynamic , not static , changing to meet the challenge of each new generation .
