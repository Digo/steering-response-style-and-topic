. Thank you so much . That 's so nice .
Isn't he a great guy . He doesn't get a fair press ; he doesn't get it .
It 's just not fair . And I have to tell you I 'm here , and very strongly here , because I have great respect for Steve King and have great respect likewise for Citizens United , David and everybody , and tremendous resect for the Tea Party .
Also , also the people of Iowa . They have something in common .
Hard-working people . They want to work , they want to make the country great .
I love the people of Iowa . So that 's the way it is .
Very simple .
With that said , our country is really headed in the wrong direction with a president who is doing an absolutely terrible job .
The world is collapsing around us , and many of the problems we 've caused .
Our president is either grossly incompetent , a word that more and more people are using , and I think I was the first to use it , or he has a completely different agenda than you want to know about , which could be possible .
In any event , Washington is broken , and our country is in serious trouble and total disarray .
Very simple . Politicians are all talk , no action .
They are all talk and no action . And it 's constant ; it never ends .
And I 'm a conservative , actually very conservative , and I 'm a Republican .
And I 'm very disappointed by our Republican politicians . Because they let the president get away with absolute murder .
You see always , oh we 're going to do this , we 're going to- . Nothing ever happens ; nothing ever happens .
You look at Obamacare . A total catastrophe and by the way it really kicks in in ' 16 and it is going to be a disaster .
People are closing up shops . Doctors are quitting the business .
I have a friend of mine who 's a doctor , a very good doctor , a very successful guy .
He said , I have more accountants than I have patients .
And he needs because it is so complicated and so terrible and he 's never had that before
and he 's going to close up his business . And he was very successful guy .
But it 's happening more and more .
Look at Obamacare with a $5 billion website . I have many websites , many , many websites .
They 're all over the place . But for $10 , okay ?
Now everything about Obamacare was a lie . It was a filthy lie .
And when you think about it , lies , I mean are they prosecuted ?
Does anyone do anything ? And what are the Republican politicians doing about it ?
He lied about the doctor , he lied about every aspect .
You can keep your plan . And you 've all heard that hundreds of times .
That 's like the real estate location , location . I don't even say it anymore because everybody goes location , location .
But you have heard this about Obamacare .
And it 's disgraceful . It 's a big , fat , horrible lie .
Your deductibles are going through the roof . You 're not going to get-unless you 're hit by an army tank , you 're not going to get coverage .
And people that had plans that they loved , that they really loved , don't have those plans anymore .
So it 's a real , real disaster . And somebody has to repeal and replace Obamacare .
And they have to do it fast and not just talk about it .
Now , we have to build a fence . And it 's got to be a beauty .
Who can build better than Trump ? I build ; it 's what I do .
I build ; I build nice fences , but I build great buildings .
Fences are easy , believe me . I saw the other day on television people just walking across the border .
They 're walking . The military is standing there holding guns and people are just walking right in front , coming into our country .
It is so terrible . It is so unfair . It is so incompetent .
And we don't have the best coming in . We have people that are criminals , we have people that are crooks .
You can certainly have terrorists . You can certainly have Islamic terrorists .
You can have anything coming across the border . We don't do anything about it .
So I would say that if I run and if I win , I would certainly start by building a very , very powerful border .
Again , the politicians talk about it and they do nothing about it .
Benghazi . Oh , Benghazi , Benghazi . Everything is Benghazi .
What happens ? Nothing .
IRS , e-mails . I get sued all the time , okay .
I run a big business . You know I 've always said it 's very , very hard for a person who is very successful .
I have done so many deals . Almost all of them have been tremendously successful .
You 'll see that when I file my statements . I mean you will see ; you will be very proud of me , okay .
But I 've always said , and I said it strongly , it 's very hard for somebody that does tremendous numbers of deals to run for politics , run for political office , any office , let alone president .
Because you 've done so much ; you 've beaten so many people ; you 've created so many- Look , Obama , what did he do ?
No deal . He never did a deal . He did one deal .
A house . And if you did that house you 'd be in jail right now , okay .
He got away with murder . But I can tell you , e-mails .
IRS , the e-mails , thousands of them , they were lost ; they were lost .
If you were in my world you would know that e-mails can't be lost ; they can't be lost .
So why aren't our politicians finding out where those e-mails are ?
They talk about executive orders and they talk about immigration and they talk about oh well we have to stop the border ; that 's the end of it .
Believe me if I did something you would have a border that would be great .
But they talk about it . And then you have a president that does an executive order .
Nobody even heard of an executive order . He does it to let people come in and nobody does anything about executive orders .
Why didn't they go to court and ask for declaratory judgment-which is something that when you know somebody is going to go after you and when it 's in writing , and he 's been saying it for a long time ; he said , I 'm going to approve this and that-why didn't our Republicans go in and get a declaratory judgment from the courts because you could have started the process six months earlier .
Instead they have a weak lawsuit , that probably the time it 's finished , I know so much about this , six , seven , eight years from now everyone 's going to forget about it .
We 'll be into a different mode , and our country will be further destroyed .
So we have to do something .
Jobs . China . I mean I 've made so much money fighting against the Chinese .
One of the best deals I ever did was against the Chinese , and they respect me for it .
And I know them . And they say , we can't believe what we 're getting away with .
We can't believe how stupid your leaders are . They tell me that .
Now they don't know I 'm going to go and make a speech about it , but why not .
But they tell me that .
And by the way , especially for the folks here that sell so much-goods , I mean the goods you sell are incredible ; I don't know if you 've been watching what 's happening with the devaluations of so many countries .
The Euro , China is going crazy with the devaluation .
I never thought that they 'd have the guts to do what they 're doing .
They are devaluing down to nothing . And what it 's going to do is make it impossible for you to sell your product ; it 's going make it impossible for you to compete .
And they 're getting away with it . And they wouldn't have even done it two years ago , but now they feel we 're so weak and we have so many different problems all over the world that they can do it .
But you watch this devaluation of all of it . I mean the Euro , China , Mexico ; everybody is devaluing .
And when you hear the dollar is getting stronger , it sounds good .
You know it 's one of those things , sounds good .
Be very careful . Be very careful . Because we 're just going to lose more and more business to these foreign countries that really know what they are doing .
They have it set . Don't forget another thing . China became the number one economic power a year ago .
That was unthinkable ; to think that that was going to happen .
It was absolutely unthinkable . So it happened and it 's very , very sad .
Now we spent $2 trillion in Iraq . We got nothing .
They don't even respect us ; they don't even care about us .
Until they started getting their ass kicked , and call , oh please come back and help us .
We want you out ; then all of the sudden a new group forms , ISIS . By the way , you know how they formed .
They took the oil . And for those of you that know and love Donald Trump-there are some of you-have I been saying for four years , keep the oil .
So now ISIS has the oil . And the stuff that ISIS doesn't have , Iran is going to take .
So we get nothing . We have $2 trillion and we have thousands of lives lost , thousands , and we have , what do we have .
I mean I walk down the streets of New York and I see so many wounded warriors , incredible people .
And we have to help those people , we have to help our vets , we have to help our military , we have to build our military .
But , and we have to do it fast ; we have to do it fast .
We have incompetent people . They put people in charge that have no clue what they 're doing .
It needs money .
We have to make our country rich again so we do that , so we can save Social Security . '
Cause I 'm not a cutter ; I 'll probably be the only Republican that does not want to cut Social Security .
I 'm not a cutter of Social Security ; I want to make the country rich so that Social Security can be afforded , and Medicare and Medicaid .
Get rid of the waste , get rid of the fraud , but you deserve your Social Security ; you 've been paying your Security .
And like , I like Congressman Ryan , I like a lot of the people that are talking about you know cutting Social Security , and by the way the Democrats are eating your lunch on this issue .
It 's an issue that you 're not going to win ; you 've got to make the country rich again and strong again so that you can afford it , and so you can afford military , and all of the other things .
Now , we have a game changer now , and the game changer is nuclear weapons .
We really do have to get strong , and we have to get strong fast .
We can't let Iran get a nuclear weapon . We can't do it .
Can't do it . We cannot let that happen . You know in the old days , I would have said 100 years ago , 50 years ago , 30 years ago , pull out and let them fight each other .
Here we are in Syria . We 're fighting people that want to overturn Syria .
Think of this . We 're fighting ISIS , but ISIS wants to overturn the government .
Maybe you let them fight for a little while and then you take out the one that remains , okay .
But think of it ; think of it . ISIS is fighting them and we are bombing the hell out of them , but we want Syria to fall .
